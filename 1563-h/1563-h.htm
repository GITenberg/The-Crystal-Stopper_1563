    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE ARRESTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two boats fastened to the little pier that jutted out from the garden
      lay rocking in its shadow. Here and there lighted windows showed through
      the thick mist on the margins of the lake. The Enghien Casino opposite
      blazed with light, though it was late in the season, the end of September.
      A few stars appeared through the clouds. A light breeze ruffled the
      surface of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsene Lupin left the summer-house where he was smoking a cigar and,
      bending forward at the end of the pier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Growler?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Masher?... Are you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man rose from each of the boats, and one of them answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get ready. I hear the car coming with Gilbert and Vaucheray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the garden, walked round a house in process of construction,
      the scaffolding of which loomed overhead, and cautiously opened the door
      on the Avenue de Ceinture. He was not mistaken: a bright light flashed
      round the bend and a large, open motor-car drew up, whence sprang two men
      in great-coats, with the collars turned up, and caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Gilbert and Vaucheray: Gilbert, a young fellow of twenty or
      twenty-two, with an attractive cast of features and a supple and sinewy
      frame; Vaucheray, older, shorter, with grizzled hair and a pale, sickly
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Lupin, &ldquo;did you see him, the deputy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, governor,&rdquo; said Gilbert, &ldquo;we saw him take the 7.40 tram for Paris,
      as we knew he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are free to act?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. The Villa Marie-Therese is ours to do as we please with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur had kept his seat. Lupin gave him his orders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait here. It might attract attention. Be back at half-past nine
      exactly, in time to load the car unless the whole business falls through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it fall through?&rdquo; observed Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor drove away; and Lupin, taking the road to the lake with his two
      companions, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because I didn&rsquo;t prepare the plan; and, when I don&rsquo;t do a thing
      myself, I am only half-confident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, governor! I&rsquo;ve been working with you for three years now... I&rsquo;m
      beginning to know the ropes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lad, you&rsquo;re beginning,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just why I&rsquo;m
      afraid of blunders... Here, get in with me... And you, Vaucheray, take the
      other boat... That&rsquo;s it... And now push off, boys... and make as little
      noise as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Growler and Masher, the two oarsmen, made straight for the opposite bank,
      a little to the left of the casino.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met a boat containing a couple locked in each other&rsquo;s arms, floating
      at random, and another in which a number of people were singing at the top
      of their voices. And that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin shifted closer to his companion and said, under his breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Gilbert, did you think of this job, or was it Vaucheray&rsquo;s idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you: we&rsquo;ve both of us been discussing it
      for weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is, I don&rsquo;t trust Vaucheray: he&rsquo;s a low ruffian when one gets
      to know him... I can&rsquo;t make out why I don&rsquo;t get rid of him...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, governor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I mean what I say: he&rsquo;s a dangerous fellow, to say nothing of
      the fact that he has some rather serious peccadilloes on his conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat silent for a moment and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re quite sure that you saw Daubrecq the deputy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw him with my own eyes, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know that he has an appointment in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to the theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; but his servants have remained behind at the Enghien
      villa....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cook has been sent away. As for the valet, Leonard, who is Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      confidential man, he&rsquo;ll wait for his master in Paris. They can&rsquo;t get back
      from town before one o&rsquo;clock in the morning. But...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must reckon with a possible freak of fancy on Daubrecq&rsquo;s part, a
      change of mind, an unexpected return, and so arrange to have everything
      finished and done with in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did you get these details?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning. Vaucheray and I at once thought that it was a favourable
      moment. I selected the garden of the unfinished house which we have just
      left as the best place to start from; for the house is not watched at
      night. I sent for two mates to row the boats; and I telephoned to you.
      That&rsquo;s the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the keys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The keys of the front-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the villa which I see from here, standing in its own grounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Villa Marie-Therese; and as the two others, with the gardens
      touching it on either side, have been unoccupied since this day week, we
      shall be able to remove what we please at our leisure; and I swear to you,
      governor, it&rsquo;s well worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The job&rsquo;s much too simple,&rdquo; mumbled Lupin. &ldquo;No charm about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They landed in a little creek whence rose a few stone steps, under cover
      of a mouldering roof. Lupin reflected that shipping the furniture would be
      easy work. But, suddenly, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are people at the villa. Look... a light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gas-jet, governor. The light&rsquo;s not moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Growler stayed by the boats, with instructions to keep watch, while
      the Masher, the other rower, went to the gate on the Avenue de Ceinture,
      and Lupin and his two companions crept in the shadow to the foot of the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert went up first. Groping in the dark, he inserted first the big
      door-key and then the latch-key. Both turned easily in their locks, the
      door opened and the three men walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gas-jet was flaring in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, governor...&rdquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Lupin, in a low voice, &ldquo;but it seems to me that the light
      which I saw shining did not come from here...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did it come from then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say... Is this the drawing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gilbert, who was not afraid to speak pretty loudly, &ldquo;no. By
      way of precaution, he keeps everything on the first floor, in his bedroom
      and in the two rooms on either side of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the staircase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the right, behind the curtain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin moved to the curtain and was drawing the hanging aside when,
      suddenly, at four steps on the left, a door opened and a head appeared, a
      pallid man&rsquo;s head, with terrified eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Murder!&rdquo; shouted the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he rushed back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Leonard, the valet!&rdquo; cried Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he makes a fuss, I&rsquo;ll out him,&rdquo; growled Vaucheray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll jolly well do nothing of the sort, do you hear, Vaucheray?&rdquo; said
      Lupin, peremptorily. And he darted off in pursuit of the servant. He first
      went through a dining-room, where he saw a lamp still lit, with plates and
      a bottle around it, and he found Leonard at the further end of a pantry,
      making vain efforts to open the window:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, sportie! No kid! Ah, the brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thrown himself flat on the floor, on seeing Leonard raise his arm
      at him. Three shots were fired in the dusk of the pantry; and then the
      valet came tumbling to the ground, seized by the legs by Lupin, who
      snatched his weapon from him and gripped him by the throat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out, you dirty brute!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;He very nearly did for me...
      Here, Vaucheray, secure this gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw the light of his pocket-lantern on the servant&rsquo;s face and
      chuckled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a pretty gentleman either... You can&rsquo;t have a very clear
      conscience, Leonard; besides, to play flunkey to Daubrecq the deputy...!
      Have you finished, Vaucheray? I don&rsquo;t want to hang about here for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger, governor,&rdquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really?... So you think that shots can&rsquo;t be heard?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, we must look sharp. Vaucheray, take the lamp and let&rsquo;s go
      upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Gilbert by the arm and, as he dragged him to the first floor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that the way you make inquiries? Wasn&rsquo;t I right to
      have my doubts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, governor, I couldn&rsquo;t know that he would change his mind and
      come back to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&rsquo;s got to know everything when one has the honour of breaking into
      people&rsquo;s houses. You numskull! I&rsquo;ll remember you and Vaucheray... a nice
      pair of gossoons!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the furniture on the first floor pacified Lupin and he
      started on his inventory with the satisfied air of a collector who has
      looked in to treat himself to a few works of art:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jingo! There&rsquo;s not much of it, but what there is is pucka! There&rsquo;s
      nothing the matter with this representative of the people in the question
      of taste. Four Aubusson chairs... A bureau signed &lsquo;Percier-Fontaine,&rsquo; for
      a wager... Two inlays by Gouttieres... A genuine Fragonard and a sham
      Nattier which any American millionaire will swallow for the asking: in
      short, a fortune... And there are curmudgeons who pretend that there&rsquo;s
      nothing but faked stuff left. Dash it all, why don&rsquo;t they do as I do? They
      should look about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert and Vaucheray, following Lupin&rsquo;s orders and instructions, at once
      proceeded methodically to remove the bulkier pieces. The first boat was
      filled in half an hour; and it was decided that the Growler and the Masher
      should go on ahead and begin to load the motor-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin went to see them start. On returning to the house, it struck him, as
      he passed through the hall, that he heard a voice in the pantry. He went
      there and found Leonard lying flat on his stomach, quite alone, with his
      hands tied behind his back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you growling, my confidential flunkey? Don&rsquo;t get excited: it&rsquo;s
      almost finished. Only, if you make too much noise, you&rsquo;ll oblige us to
      take severer measures... Do you like pears? We might give you one, you
      know: a choke-pear!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he went upstairs, he again heard the same sound and, stopping to
      listen, he caught these words, uttered in a hoarse, groaning voice, which
      came, beyond a doubt, from the pantry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!... Murder!... Help!... I shall be killed!... Inform the
      commissary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s clean off his chump!&rdquo; muttered Lupin. &ldquo;By Jove!... To
      disturb the police at nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening: there&rsquo;s a notion for
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He set to work again. It took longer than he expected, for they discovered
      in the cupboards all sorts of valuable knick-knacks which it would have
      been very wrong to disdain and, on the other hand, Vaucheray and Gilbert
      were going about their investigations with signs of laboured concentration
      that nonplussed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At long last, he lost his patience:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to spoil the whole job and keep
      the motor waiting for the sake of the few odd bits that remain. I&rsquo;m taking
      the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were now by the waterside and Lupin went down the steps. Gilbert held
      him back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, governor, we want one more look round five minutes, no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what for, dash it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this: we were told of an old reliquary, something
      stunning...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t lay our hands on it. And I was thinking... There&rsquo;s a cupboard
      with a big lock to it in the pantry... You see, we can&rsquo;t very well...&rdquo; He
      was already on his way to the villa. Vaucheray ran back too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten minutes, not a second longer!&rdquo; cried Lupin. &ldquo;In ten
      minutes, I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the ten minutes passed and he was still waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter-past nine,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;This is madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he also remembered that Gilbert and Vaucheray had behaved rather
      queerly throughout the removal of the things, keeping close together and
      apparently watching each other. What could be happening?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin mechanically returned to the house, urged by a feeling of anxiety
      which he was unable to explain; and, at the same time, he listened to a
      dull sound which rose in the distance, from the direction of Enghien, and
      which seemed to be coming nearer... People strolling about, no doubt...
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sharp whistle and then went to the main gate, to take a glance
      down the avenue. But, suddenly, as he was opening the gate, a shot rang
      out, followed by a yell of pain. He returned at a run, went round the
      house, leapt up the steps and rushed to the dining-room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast it all, what are you doing there, you two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert and Vaucheray, locked in a furious embrace, were rolling on the
      floor, uttering cries of rage. Their clothes were dripping with blood.
      Lupin flew at them to separate them. But already Gilbert had got his
      adversary down and was wrenching out of his hand something which Lupin had
      no time to see. And Vaucheray, who was losing blood through a wound in the
      shoulder, fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who hurt him? You, Gilbert?&rdquo; asked Lupin, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Leonard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard? Why, he was tied up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He undid his fastenings and got hold of his revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrel! Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin took the lamp and went into the pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man-servant was lying on his back, with his arms outstretched, a
      dagger stuck in his throat and a livid face. A red stream trickled from
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; gasped Lupin, after examining him, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?... Do you think so?&rdquo; stammered Gilbert, in a trembling
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Vaucheray... it was Vaucheray who did it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pale with anger, Lupin caught hold of him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Vaucheray, was it?... And you too, you blackguard, since you were
      there and didn&rsquo;t stop him! Blood! Blood! You know I won&rsquo;t have it... Well,
      it&rsquo;s a bad lookout for you, my fine fellows... You&rsquo;ll have to pay the
      damage! And you won&rsquo;t get off cheaply either... Mind the guillotine!&rdquo; And,
      shaking him violently, &ldquo;What was it? Why did he kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted to go through his pockets and take the key of the cupboard from
      him. When he stooped over him, he saw that the man unloosed his arms. He
      got frightened... and he stabbed him...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the revolver-shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Leonard... he had his revolver in his hand... he just had strength
      to take aim before he died...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the key of the cupboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaucheray took it....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he open it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he find what he was after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wanted to take the thing from him. What sort of thing was it? The
      reliquary? No, it was too small for that.... Then what was it? Answer me,
      will you?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin gathered from Gilbert&rsquo;s silence and the determined expression on his
      face that he would not obtain a reply. With a threatening gesture, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      make you talk, my man. Sure as my name&rsquo;s Lupin, you shall come out with
      it. But, for the moment, we must see about decamping. Here, help me. We
      must get Vaucheray into the boat...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had returned to the dining-room and Gilbert was bending over the
      wounded man, when Lupin stopped him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged one look of alarm... Some one was speaking in the pantry
      ... a very low, strange, very distant voice... Nevertheless, as they at
      once made certain, there was no one in the room, no one except the dead
      man, whose dark outline lay stretched upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the voice spake anew, by turns shrill, stifled, bleating, stammering,
      yelling, fearsome. It uttered indistinct words, broken syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin felt the top of his head covering with perspiration. What was this
      incoherent voice, mysterious as a voice from beyond the grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had knelt down by the man-servant&rsquo;s side. The voice was silent and then
      began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us a better light,&rdquo; he said to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was trembling a little, shaken with a nervous dread which he was unable
      to master, for there was no doubt possible: when Gilbert had removed the
      shade from the lamp, Lupin realized that the voice issued from the corpse
      itself, without a movement of the lifeless mass, without a quiver of the
      bleeding mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor, I&rsquo;ve got the shivers,&rdquo; stammered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the same voice, the same snuffling whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Lupin burst out laughing, seized the corpse and pulled it aside:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; he said, catching sight of an object made of polished metal.
      &ldquo;Exactly! That&rsquo;s it!... Well, upon my word, it took me long enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the spot on the floor which he had uncovered lay the receiver of a
      telephone, the cord of which ran up to the apparatus fixed on the wall, at
      the usual height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin put the receiver to his ear. The noise began again at once, but it
      was a mixed noise, made up of different calls, exclamations, confused
      cries, the noise produced by a number of persons questioning one another
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there?... He won&rsquo;t answer. It&rsquo;s awful... They must have killed
      him. What is it?... Keep up your courage. There&rsquo;s help on the way...
      police... soldiers...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it!&rdquo; said Lupin, dropping the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth appeared to him in a terrifying vision. Quite at the beginning,
      while the things upstairs were being moved, Leonard, whose bonds were not
      securely fastened, had contrived to scramble to his feet, to unhook the
      receiver, probably with his teeth, to drop it and to appeal for assistance
      to the Enghien telephone-exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      And those were the words which Lupin had overheard, after the first boat
      started:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was the reply of the exchange. The police were hurrying to the
      spot. And Lupin remembered the sounds which he had heard from the garden,
      four or five minutes earlier, at most:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police! Take to your heels!&rdquo; he shouted, darting across the dining
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Vaucheray?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, can&rsquo;t be helped!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Vaucheray, waking from his torpor, entreated him as he passed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor, you wouldn&rsquo;t leave me like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin stopped, in spite of the danger, and was lifting the wounded man,
      with Gilbert&rsquo;s assistance, when a loud din arose outside:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, blows shook the hall-door at the back of the house. He ran
      to the front steps: a number of men had already turned the corner of the
      house at a rush. He might have managed to keep ahead of them, with
      Gilbert, and reach the waterside. But what chance was there of embarking
      and escaping under the enemy&rsquo;s fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked and bolted the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are surrounded... and done for,&rdquo; spluttered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve seen us, governor. There, they&rsquo;re knocking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; Lupin repeated. &ldquo;Not a word. Not a movement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He himself remained unperturbed, with an utterly calm face and the pensive
      attitude of one who has all the time that he needs to examine a delicate
      situation from every point of view. He had reached one of those minutes
      which he called the &ldquo;superior moments of existence,&rdquo; those which alone
      give a value and a price to life. On such occasions, however threatening
      the danger, he always began by counting to himself, slowly&mdash;&ldquo;One...
      Two... Three... Four.... Five... Six&rdquo;&mdash;until the beating of his heart
      became normal and regular. Then and not till then, he reflected, but with
      what intensity, with what perspicacity, with what a profound intuition of
      possibilities! All the factors of the problem were present in his mind. He
      foresaw everything. He admitted everything. And he took his resolution in
      all logic and in all certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thirty or forty seconds, while the men outside were banging at the
      doors and picking the locks, he said to his companion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the dining-room, he softly opened the sash and drew the
      Venetian blinds of a window in the side-wall. People were coming and
      going, rendering flight out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he began to shout with all his might, in a breathless voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way!... Help!... I&rsquo;ve got them!... This way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed his revolver and fired two shots into the tree-tops. Then he
      went back to Vaucheray, bent over him and smeared his face and hands with
      the wounded man&rsquo;s blood. Lastly, turning upon Gilbert, he took him
      violently by the shoulders and threw him to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, governor? There&rsquo;s a nice thing to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me do as I please,&rdquo; said Lupin, laying an imperative stress on every
      syllable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for everything... I&rsquo;ll answer for the two of you...
      Let me do as I like with you... I&rsquo;ll get you both out of prison ... But I
      can only do that if I&rsquo;m free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Excited cries rose through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got them! Help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, quietly, in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think for a moment... Have you anything to say to me?... Something
      that can be of use to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was too much taken aback to understand Lupin&rsquo;s plan and he
      struggled furiously. Vaucheray showed more intelligence; moreover, he had
      given up all hope of escape, because of his wound; and he snarled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the governor have his way, you ass!... As long as he gets off, isn&rsquo;t
      that the great thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Lupin remembered the article which Gilbert had put in his
      pocket, after capturing it from Vaucheray. He now tried to take it in his
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that! Not if I know it!&rdquo; growled Gilbert, managing to release
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin floored him once more. But two men suddenly appeared at the window;
      and Gilbert yielded and, handing the thing to Lupin, who pocketed it
      without looking at it, whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, governor... I&rsquo;ll explain. You can be sure that...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not have time to finish... Two policemen and others after them and
      soldiers who entered through every door and window came to Lupin&rsquo;s
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was at once seized and firmly bound. Lupin withdrew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The beggar&rsquo;s given me a lot of trouble.
      I wounded the other; but this one...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissary of police asked him, hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen the man-servant? Have they killed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I came with you from Enghien, on hearing of the murder! Only, while
      you were going round the left of the house, I went round the right. There
      was a window open. I climbed up just as these two ruffians were about to
      jump down. I fired at this one,&rdquo; pointing to Vaucheray, &ldquo;and seized hold
      of his pal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could he have been suspected? He was covered with blood. He had handed
      over the valet&rsquo;s murderers. Half a score of people had witnessed the end
      of the heroic combat which he had delivered. Besides, the uproar was too
      great for any one to take the trouble to argue or to waste time in
      entertaining doubts. In the height of the first confusion, the people of
      the neighbourhood invaded the villa. One and all lost their heads. They
      ran to every side, upstairs, downstairs, to the very cellar. They asked
      one another questions, yelled and shouted; and no one dreamt of checking
      Lupin&rsquo;s statements, which sounded so plausible.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the discovery of the body in the pantry restored the commissary
      to a sense of his responsibility. He issued orders, had the house cleared
      and placed policemen at the gate to prevent any one from passing in or
      out. Then, without further delay, he examined the spot and began his
      inquiry. Vaucheray gave his name; Gilbert refused to give his, on the plea
      that he would only speak in the presence of a lawyer. But, when he was
      accused of the murder, he informed against Vaucheray, who defended himself
      by denouncing the other; and the two of them vociferated at the same time,
      with the evident wish to monopolize the commissary&rsquo;s attention. When the
      commissary turned to Lupin, to request his evidence, he perceived that the
      stranger was no longer there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the least suspicion, he said to one of the policemen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell that gentleman that I should like to ask him a few
      questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked about for the gentleman. Some one had seen him standing on the
      steps, lighting a cigarette. The next news was that he had given
      cigarettes to a group of soldiers and strolled toward the lake, saying
      that they were to call him if he was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called him. No one replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a soldier came running up. The gentleman had just got into a boat and
      was rowing away for all he was worth. The commissary looked at Gilbert and
      realized that he had been tricked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Fire on him! He&rsquo;s an accomplice!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He himself rushed out, followed by two policemen, while the others
      remained with the prisoners. On reaching the bank, he saw the gentleman, a
      hundred yards away, taking off his hat to him in the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the policemen discharged his revolver, without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind carried the sound of words across the water. The gentleman was
      singing as he rowed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Go, little bark,
   Float in the dark...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But the commissary saw a skiff fastened to the landing-stage of the
      adjoining property. He scrambled over the hedge separating the two gardens
      and, after ordering the soldiers to watch the banks of the lake and to
      seize the fugitive if he tried to put ashore, the commissary and two of
      his men pulled off in pursuit of Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a difficult matter, for they were able to follow his movements
      by the intermittent light of the moon and to see that he was trying to
      cross the lakes while bearing toward the right&mdash;that is to say,
      toward the village of Saint-Gratien. Moreover, the commissary soon
      perceived that, with the aid of his men and thanks perhaps to the
      comparative lightness of his craft, he was rapidly gaining on the other.
      In ten minutes he had decreased the interval between them by one half.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t even need the soldiers to keep him from
      landing. I very much want to make the fellow&rsquo;s acquaintance. He&rsquo;s a cool
      hand and no mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The funny thing was that the distance was now diminishing at an abnormal
      rate, as though the fugitive had lost heart at realizing the futility of
      the struggle. The policemen redoubled their efforts. The boat shot across
      the water with the swiftness of a swallow. Another hundred yards at most
      and they would reach the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried the commissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy, whose huddled shape they could make out in the boat, no longer
      moved. The sculls drifted with the stream. And this absence of all motion
      had something alarming about it. A ruffian of that stamp might easily lie
      in wait for his aggressors, sell his life dearly and even shoot them dead
      before they had a chance of attacking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; shouted the commissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky, at that moment, was dark. The three men lay flat at the bottom of
      their skiff, for they thought they perceived a threatening gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat, carried by its own impetus, was approaching the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissary growled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let ourselves be sniped. Let&rsquo;s fire at him. Are you ready?&rdquo; And
      he roared, once more, &ldquo;Surrender... if not...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy did not budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender!... Hands up!... You refuse?... So much the worse for you...
      I&rsquo;m counting... One... Two...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policemen did not wait for the word of command. They fired and, at
      once, bending over their oars, gave the boat so powerful an impulse that
      it reached the goal in a few strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissary watched, revolver in hand, ready for the least movement. He
      raised his arm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you stir, I&rsquo;ll blow out your brains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the enemy did not stir for a moment; and, when the boat was bumped and
      the two men, letting go their oars, prepared for the formidable assault,
      the commissary understood the reason of this passive attitude: there was
      no one in the boat. The enemy had escaped by swimming, leaving in the
      hands of the victor a certain number of the stolen articles, which, heaped
      up and surmounted by a jacket and a bowler hat, might be taken, at a
      pinch, in the semi-darkness, vaguely to represent the figure of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They struck matches and examined the enemy&rsquo;s cast clothes. There were no
      initials in the hat. The jacket contained neither papers nor pocketbook.
      Nevertheless, they made a discovery which was destined to give the case no
      little celebrity and which had a terrible influence on the fate of Gilbert
      and Vaucheray: in one of the pockets was a visiting-card which the
      fugitive had left behind... the card of Arsene Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      At almost the same moment, while the police, towing the captured skiff
      behind them, continued their empty search and while the soldiers stood
      drawn up on the bank, straining their eyes to try and follow the fortunes
      of the naval combat, the aforesaid Arsene Lupin was quietly landing at the
      very spot which he had left two hours earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there met by his two other accomplices, the Growler and the Masher,
      flung them a few sentences by way of explanation, jumped into the
      motor-car, among Daubrecq the deputy&rsquo;s armchairs and other valuables,
      wrapped himself in his furs and drove, by deserted roads, to his
      repository at Neuilly, where he left the chauffeur. A taxicab brought him
      back to Paris and put him down by the church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule,
      not far from which, in the Rue Matignon, he had a flat, on the
      entresol-floor, of which none of his gang, excepting Gilbert, knew, a flat
      with a private entrance. He was glad to take off his clothes and rub
      himself down; for, in spite of his strong constitution, he felt chilled to
      the bone. On retiring to bed, he emptied the contents of his pockets, as
      usual, on the mantelpiece. It was not till then that he noticed, near his
      pocketbook and his keys, the object which Gilbert had put into his hand at
      the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was very much surprised. It was a decanter-stopper, a little
      crystal stopper, like those used for the bottles in a liqueur-stand. And
      this crystal stopper had nothing particular about it. The most that Lupin
      observed was that the knob, with its many facets, was gilded right down to
      the indent. But, to tell the truth, this detail did not seem to him of a
      nature to attract special notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was this bit of glass to which Gilbert and Vaucheray attached such
      stubborn importance!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It was for this that they
      killed the valet, fought each other, wasted their time, risked prison...
      trial... the scaffold!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too tired to linger further upon this matter, exciting though it appeared
      to him, he replaced the stopper on the chimney-piece and got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had bad dreams. Gilbert and Vaucheray were kneeling on the flags of
      their cells, wildly stretching out their hands to him and yelling with
      fright:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!... Help!&rdquo; they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, notwithstanding all his efforts, he was unable to move. He himself
      was fastened by invisible bonds. And, trembling, obsessed by a monstrous
      vision, he watched the dismal preparations, the cutting of the condemned
      men&rsquo;s hair and shirt-collars, the squalid tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, when he woke after a series of nightmares. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      lot of bad omens! Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t err on the side of superstition.
      Otherwise...!&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;For that matter, we have a talisman which,
      to judge by Gilbert and Vaucheray&rsquo;s behaviour, should be enough, with
      Lupin&rsquo;s help, to frustrate bad luck and secure the triumph of the good
      cause. Let&rsquo;s have a look at that crystal stopper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang out of bed to take the thing and examine it more closely. An
      exclamation escaped him. The crystal stopper had disappeared...

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. EIGHT FROM NINE LEAVES ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding my friendly relations with Lupin and the many flattering
      proofs of his confidence which he has given me, there is one thing which I
      have never been quite able to fathom, and that is the organization of his
      gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of the gang is an undoubted fact. Certain adventures can be
      explained only by countless acts of devotion, invincible efforts of energy
      and powerful cases of complicity, representing so many forces which all
      obey one mighty will. But how is this will exerted? Through what
      intermediaries, through what subordinates? That is what I do not know.
      Lupin keeps his secret; and the secrets which Lupin chooses to keep are,
      so to speak, impenetrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only supposition which I can allow myself to make is that this gang,
      which, in my opinion, is very limited in numbers and therefore all the
      more formidable, is completed and extended indefinitely by the addition of
      independent units, provisional associates, picked up in every class of
      society and in every country of the world, who are the executive agents of
      an authority with which, in many cases, they are not even acquainted. The
      companions, the initiates, the faithful adherents&mdash;men who play the
      leading parts under the direct command of Lupin&mdash;move to and fro
      between these secondary agents and the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert and Vaucheray evidently belonged to the main gang. And that is why
      the law showed itself so implacable in their regard. For the first time,
      it held accomplices of Lupin in its clutches&mdash;declared, undisputed
      accomplices&mdash;and those accomplices had committed a murder. If the
      murder was premeditated, if the accusation of deliberate homicide could be
      supported by substantial proofs, it meant the scaffold. Now there was, at
      the very least, one self-evident proof, the cry for assistance which
      Leonard had sent over the telephone a few minutes before his death:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The desperate appeal had been heard by two men, the operator on duty and
      one of his fellow-clerks, who swore to it positively. And it was in
      consequence of this appeal that the commissary of police, who was at once
      informed, had proceeded to the Villa Marie-Therese, escorted by his men
      and a number of soldiers off duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin had a very clear notion of the danger from the first. The fierce
      struggle in which he had engaged against society was entering upon a new
      and terrible phase. His luck was turning. It was no longer a matter of
      attacking others, but of defending himself and saving the heads of his two
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little memorandum, which I have copied from one of the note-books in
      which he often jots down a summary of the situations that perplex him,
      will show us the workings of his brain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One definite fact, to begin with, is that Gilbert and Vaucheray humbugged
      me. The Enghien expedition, undertaken ostensibly with the object of
      robbing the Villa Marie-Therese, had a secret purpose. This purpose
      obsessed their minds throughout the operations; and what they were looking
      for, under the furniture and in the cupboards, was one thing and one thing
      alone: the crystal stopper. Therefore, if I want to see clear ahead, I
      must first of all know what this means. It is certain that, for some
      hidden reason, that mysterious piece of glass possesses an incalculable
      value in their eyes. And not only in theirs, for, last night, some one was
      bold enough and clever enough to enter my flat and steal the object in
      question from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This theft of which he was the victim puzzled Lupin curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two problems, both equally difficult of solution, presented themselves to
      his mind. First, who was the mysterious visitor? Gilbert, who enjoyed his
      entire confidence and acted as his private secretary, was the only one who
      knew of the retreat in the Rue Matignon. Now Gilbert was in prison. Was
      Lupin to suppose that Gilbert had betrayed him and put the police on his
      tracks? In that case, why were they content with taking the crystal
      stopper, instead of arresting him, Lupin?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was something much stranger still. Admitting that they had been
      able to force the doors of his flat&mdash;and this he was compelled to
      admit, though there was no mark to show it&mdash;how had they succeeded in
      entering the bedroom? He turned the key and pushed the bolt as he did
      every evening, in accordance with a habit from which he never departed.
      And, nevertheless&mdash;the fact was undeniable&mdash;the crystal stopper
      had disappeared without the lock or the bolt having been touched. And,
      although Lupin flattered himself that he had sharp ears, even when asleep,
      not a sound had waked him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no great pains to probe the mystery. He knew those problems too
      well to hope that this one could be solved other than in the course of
      events. But, feeling very much put out and exceedingly uneasy, he then and
      there locked up his entresol flat in the Rue Matignon and swore that he
      would never set foot in it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he applied himself forthwith to the question of corresponding with
      Vaucheray or Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a fresh disappointment awaited him. It was so clearly understood,
      both at the Sante Prison and at the Law Courts, that all communication
      between Lupin and the prisoners must be absolutely prevented, that a
      multitude of minute precautions were ordered by the prefect of police and
      minutely observed by the lowest subordinates. Tried policemen, always the
      same men, watched Gilbert and Vaucheray, day and night, and never let them
      out of their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, at this time, had not yet promoted himself to the crowning honour
      of his career, the post of chief of the detective-service, [*] and,
      consequently, was not able to take steps at the Law Courts to insure the
      execution of his plans. After a fortnight of fruitless endeavours, he was
      obliged to bow.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See 813, by Maurice Leblanc, translated by Alexander
     Teixeira de Mattos.
</pre>
    <p>
      He did so with a raging heart and a growing sense of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difficult part of a business,&rdquo; he often says, &ldquo;is not the finish, but
      the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where was he to start in the present circumstances? What road was he to
      follow?
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts recurred to Daubrecq the deputy, the original owner of the
      crystal stopper, who probably knew its importance. On the other hand, how
      was Gilbert aware of the doings and mode of life of Daubrecq the deputy?
      What means had he employed to keep him under observation? Who had told him
      of the place where Daubrecq spent the evening of that day? These were all
      interesting questions to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had moved to his winter quarters in Paris immediately after the
      burglary at the Villa Marie-Therese and was now living in his own house,
      on the left-hand side of the little Square Lamartine that opens out at the
      end of the Avenue Victor-Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      First disguising himself as an old gentleman of private means, strolling
      about, cane in hand, Lupin spent his time in the neighbourhood, on the
      benches of the square and the avenue. He made a discovery on the first
      day. Two men, dressed as workmen, but behaving in a manner that left no
      doubt as to their aims, were watching the deputy&rsquo;s house. When Daubrecq
      went out, they set off in pursuit of him; and they were immediately behind
      him when he came home again. At night, as soon as the lights were out,
      they went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin shadowed them in his turn. They were detective-officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, hullo!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;This is hardly what I expected. So
      the Daubrecq bird is under suspicion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, on the fourth day, at nightfall, the two men were joined by six
      others, who conversed with them in the darkest part of the Square
      Lamartine. And, among these new arrivals, Lupin was vastly astonished to
      recognize, by his figure and bearing, the famous Prasville, the erstwhile
      barrister, sportsman and explorer, now favourite at the Elysee, who, for
      some mysterious reason, had been pitchforked into the headquarters of
      police as secretary-general, with the reversion of the prefecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, suddenly, Lupin remembered: two years ago, Prasville and Daubrecq the
      deputy had had a personal encounter on the Place du Palais-Bourbon. The
      incident made a great stir at the time. No one knew the cause of it.
      Prasville had sent his seconds to Daubrecq on the same day; but Daubrecq
      refused to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while later, Prasville was appointed secretary-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd, very odd,&rdquo; said Lupin, who remained plunged in thought, while
      continuing to observe Prasville&rsquo;s movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock Prasville&rsquo;s group of men moved away a few yards, in the
      direction of the Avenue Henri-Martin. The door of a small garden on the
      right of the house opened and Daubrecq appeared. The two detectives
      followed close behind him and, when he took the Rue-Taitbout train, jumped
      on after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville at once walked across the square and rang the bell. The
      garden-gate was between the house and the porter&rsquo;s lodge. The portress
      came and opened it. There was a brief conversation, after which Prasville
      and his companions were admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A domiciliary visit,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Secret and illegal. By the strict
      rules of politeness, I ought to be invited. My presence is indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without the least hesitation he went up to the house, the door of which
      had not been closed, and, passing in front of the portress, who was
      casting her eyes outside, he asked, in the hurried tones of a person who
      is late for an appointment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the gentlemen come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will find them in the study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His plan was quite simple: if any one met him, he would pretend to be a
      tradesman. But there was no need for this subterfuge. He was able, after
      crossing an empty hall, to enter a dining-room which also had no one in
      it, but which, through the panes of a glass partition that separated the
      dining-room from the study, afforded him a view of Prasville and his five
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville opened all the drawers with the aid of false keys. Next, he
      examined all the papers, while his companions took down the books from the
      shelves, shook the pages of each separately and felt inside the bindings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s a paper they&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Bank-notes,
      perhaps...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rot! We shan&rsquo;t find a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet he obviously did not abandon all hope of discovering what he wanted,
      for he suddenly seized the four bottles in a liqueur-stand, took out the
      four stoppers and inspected them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; thought Lupin. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s going for decanter-stoppers! Then it&rsquo;s
      not a question of a paper? Well, I give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville next lifted and examined different objects; and he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often have you been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six times last winter,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have searched the house thoroughly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one of the rooms, for days at a time, while he was visiting his
      constituency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still... still...&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;Has he no servant at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is looking for one. He has his meals out and the portress keeps
      the house as best she can. The woman is devoted to us...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville persisted in his investigations for nearly an hour and a half,
      shifting and fingering all the knick-knacks, but taking care to put
      everything back exactly where he found it. At nine o&rsquo;clock, however, the
      two detectives who had followed Daubrecq burst into the study:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville and the men from the police-office withdrew, without undue
      haste, after taking a last glance round the room to make sure that there
      was nothing to betray their visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position was becoming critical for Lupin. He ran the risk of knocking
      up against Daubrecq, if he went away, or of not being able to get out, if
      he remained. But, on ascertaining that the dining-room windows afforded a
      direct means of exit to the square, he resolved to stay. Besides, the
      opportunity of obtaining a close view of Daubrecq was too good to refuse;
      and, as Daubrecq had been out to dinner, there was not much chance of his
      entering the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, therefore, waited, holding himself ready to hide behind a velvet
      curtain that could be drawn across the glazed partition in case of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the sound of doors opening and shutting. Some one walked into the
      study and switched on the light. He recognized Daubrecq.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputy was a stout, thickset, bull-necked man, very nearly bald, with
      a fringe of gray whiskers round his chin and wearing a pair of black
      eye-glasses under his spectacles, for his eyes were weak and strained.
      Lupin noticed the powerful features, the square chin, the prominent
      cheek-bones. The hands were brawny and covered with hair, the legs bowed;
      and he walked with a stoop, bearing first on one hip and then on the
      other, which gave him something of the gait of a gorilla. But the face was
      topped by an enormous, lined forehead, indented with hollows and dotted
      with bumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something bestial, something savage, something repulsive about
      the man&rsquo;s whole personality. Lupin remembered that, in the Chamber of
      Deputies, Daubrecq was nicknamed &ldquo;The Wild Man of the Woods&rdquo; and that he
      was so labelled not only because he stood aloof and hardly ever mixed with
      his fellow-members, but also because of his appearance, his behaviour, his
      peculiar gait and his remarkable muscular development.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to his desk, took a meerschaum pipe from his pocket, selected
      a packet of caporal among several packets of tobacco which lay drying in a
      bowl, tore open the wrapper, filled his pipe and lit it. Then he began to
      write letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he ceased his work and sat thinking, with his attention fixed on
      a spot on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted a little stamp-box and examined it. Next, he verified the
      position of different articles which Prasville had touched and replaced;
      and he searched them with his eyes, felt them with his hands, bending over
      them as though certain signs, known to himself alone, were able to tell
      him what he wished to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he grasped the knob on an electric bell-push and rang. The
      portress appeared a minute later.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when the woman hesitated about replying, he insisted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Clemence, did you open this stampbox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I fastened the lid down with a little strip of gummed paper. The
      strip has been broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you,...&rdquo; the woman began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why tell lies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;considering that I myself instructed you to
      lend yourself to those visits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is that you want to keep on good terms with both sides... Very
      well!&rdquo; He handed her a fifty-franc note and repeated, &ldquo;Have they been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same men as in the spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all five of them... with another one, who ordered them about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tall, dark man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin saw Daubrecq&rsquo;s mouth hardening; and Daubrecq continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one more, who came after they did and joined them... and then,
      just now, two more, the pair who usually keep watch outside the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they remain in the study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they went away when I came back? A few minutes before, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman left the room. Daubrecq returned to his letter-writing. Then,
      stretching out his arm, he made some marks on a white writing-tablet, at
      the end of his desk, and rested it against the desk, as though he wished
      to keep it in sight. The marks were figures; and Lupin was able to read
      the following subtraction-sum:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;9 - 8 = 1&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Daubrecq, speaking between his teeth, thoughtfully uttered the
      syllables:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight from nine leaves one... There&rsquo;s not a doubt about that,&rdquo; he added,
      aloud. He wrote one more letter, a very short one, and addressed the
      envelope with an inscription which Lupin was able to decipher when the
      letter was placed beside the writing-tablet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Monsieur Prasville, Secretary-general of the Prefecture of Police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rang the bell again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clemence,&rdquo; he said, to the portress, &ldquo;did you go to school as a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, of course I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you taught arithmetic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not very good at subtraction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you don&rsquo;t know that nine minus eight equals one. And that, you
      see, is a fact of the highest importance. Life becomes impossible if you
      are ignorant of that fundamental truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, as he spoke, and walked round the room, with his hands behind his
      back, swaying upon his hips. He did so once more. Then, stopping at the
      dining-room, he opened the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matter, there&rsquo;s another way of putting the problem. Take eight
      from nine; and one remains. And the one who remains is here, eh? Correct!
      And monsieur supplies us with a striking proof, does he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted the velvet curtain in which Lupin had hurriedly wrapped himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, sir, you must be stifling under this! Not to say that I
      might have amused myself by sticking a dagger through the curtain.
      Remember Hamlet&rsquo;s madness and Polonius&rsquo; death: &lsquo;How now! A rat? Dead, for
      a ducat, dead!&rsquo; Come along, Mr. Polonius, come out of your hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those positions to which Lupin was not accustomed and which
      he loathed. To catch others in a trap and pull their leg was all very
      well; but it was a very different thing to have people teasing him and
      roaring with laughter at his expense. Yet what could he answer back?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look a little pale, Mr. Polonius... Hullo! Why, it&rsquo;s the respectable
      old gentleman who has been hanging about the square for some days! So you
      belong to the police too, Mr. Polonius? There, there, pull yourself
      together, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt you!... But you see, Clemence, how right my
      calculation was. You told me that nine spies had been to the house. I
      counted a troop of eight, as I came along, eight of them in the distance,
      down the avenue. Take eight from nine and one remains: the one who
      evidently remained behind to see what he could see. Ecce homo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? And then?&rdquo; said Lupin, who felt a mad craving to fly at the fellow
      and reduce him to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then? Nothing at all, my good man... What more do you want? The farce
      is over. I will only ask you to take this little note to Master Prasville,
      your employer. Clemence, please show Mr. Polonius out. And, if ever he
      calls again, fling open the doors wide to him. Pray look upon this as your
      home, Mr. Polonius. Your servant, sir!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin hesitated. He would have liked to talk big and to come out with a
      farewell phrase, a parting speech, like an actor making a showy exit from
      the stage, and at least to disappear with the honours of war. But his
      defeat was so pitiable that he could think of nothing better than to bang
      his hat on his head and stamp his feet as he followed the portress down
      the hall. It was a poor revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rascally beggar!&rdquo; he shouted, once he was outside the door, shaking
      his fist at Daubrecq&rsquo;s windows. &ldquo;Wretch, scum of the earth, deputy, you
      shall pay for this!... Oh, he allows himself...! Oh, he has the cheek
      to...! Well, I swear to you, my fine fellow, that, one of these days...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was foaming with rage, all the more as, in his innermost heart, he
      recognized the strength of his new enemy and could not deny the masterly
      fashion in which he had managed this business. Daubrecq&rsquo;s coolness, the
      assurance with which he hoaxed the police-officials, the contempt with
      which he lent himself to their visits at his house and, above all, his
      wonderful self-possession, his easy bearing and the impertinence of his
      conduct in the presence of the ninth person who was spying on him: all
      this denoted a man of character, a strong man, with a well-balanced mind,
      lucid, bold, sure of himself and of the cards in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what were those cards? What game was he playing? Who held the stakes?
      And how did the players stand on either side? Lupin could not tell.
      Knowing nothing, he flung himself headlong into the thick of the fray,
      between adversaries desperately involved, though he himself was in total
      ignorance of their positions, their weapons, their resources and their
      secret plans. For, when all was said, he could not admit that the object
      of all those efforts was to obtain possession of a crystal stopper!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing alone pleased him: Daubrecq had not penetrated his disguise.
      Daubrecq believed him to be in the employ of the police. Neither Daubrecq
      nor the police, therefore, suspected the intrusion of a third thief in the
      business. This was his one and only trump, a trump that gave him a liberty
      of action to which he attached the greatest importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further delay, he opened the letter which Daubrecq had handed him
      for the secretary-general of police. It contained these few lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Within reach of your hand, my dear Prasville, within reach of your
 hand!  You touched it!  A little more and the trick was done... But
 you&rsquo;re too big a fool.  And to think that they couldn&rsquo;t hit upon
 any one better than you to make me bite the dust.  Poor old France!

 &ldquo;Good-bye, Prasville.  But, if I catch you in the act, it will be a
 bad lookout for you: my maxim is to shoot at sight.

         &ldquo;DAUBRECQ&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within reach of your hand,&rdquo; repeated Lupin, after reading the note. &ldquo;And
      to think that the rogue may be writing the truth! The most elementary
      hiding-places are the safest. We must look into this, all the same. And,
      also, we must find out why Daubrecq is the object of such strict
      supervision and obtain a few particulars about the fellow generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The information supplied to Lupin by a private inquiry-office consisted of
      the following details:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;ALEXIS DAUBRECQ, deputy of the Bouches-du-Rhone for the past two
 years; sits among the independent members.  Political opinions not
 very clearly defined, but electoral position exceedingly strong,
 because of the enormous sums which he spends in nursing his
 constituency.  No private income.  Nevertheless, has a house in
 Paris, a villa at Enghien and another at Nice and loses heavily at
 play, though no one knows where the money comes from.  Has great
 influence and obtains all he wants without making up to ministers
 or, apparently, having either friends or connections in political
 circles.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a trade docket,&rdquo; said Lupin to himself. &ldquo;What I want is a domestic
      docket, a police docket, which will tell me about the gentleman&rsquo;s private
      life and enable me to work more easily in this darkness and to know if I&rsquo;m
      not getting myself into a tangle by bothering about the Daubrecq bird. And
      time&rsquo;s getting short, hang it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the residences which Lupin occupied at that period and which he
      used oftener than any of the others was in the Rue Chateaubriand, near the
      Arc de l&rsquo;Etoile. He was known there by the name of Michel Beaumont. He had
      a snug flat here and was looked after by a manservant, Achille, who was
      utterly devoted to his interests and whose chief duty was to receive and
      repeat the telephone-messages addressed to Lupin by his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, on returning home, learnt, with great astonishment, that a woman
      had been waiting to see him for over an hour:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Why, no one ever comes to see me here! Is she young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wearing a lace shawl over her head, instead of a hat, and you can&rsquo;t
      see her face... She&rsquo;s more like a clerk... or a woman employed in a shop.
      She&rsquo;s not well-dressed...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did she ask for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Michel Beaumont,&rdquo; replied the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer. And why has she called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All she said was that it was about the Enghien business... So I thought
      that...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! The Enghien business! Then she knows that I am mixed up in that
      business... She knows that, by applying here...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not get anything out of her, but I thought, all the same, that I
      had better let her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the drawing-room. I&rsquo;ve put on the lights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin walked briskly across the hall and opened the door of the
      drawing-room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he said, to his man. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one here?&rdquo; said Achille, running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the room, in fact, was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, on my word, this takes the cake!&rdquo; cried the servant. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
      twenty minutes ago that I came and had a look, to make sure. She was
      sitting over there. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my eyesight, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, look here,&rdquo; said Lupin, irritably. &ldquo;Where were you while the
      woman was waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hall, governor! I never left the hall for a second! I should have
      seen her go out, blow it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, she&rsquo;s not here now...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; moaned the man, quite flabbergasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have got tired of waiting and gone away. But, dash it all, I
      should like to know how she got out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How she got out?&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take a wizard to tell that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She got out through the window. Look, it&rsquo;s still ajar. We are on the
      ground-floor... The street is almost always deserted, in the evenings.
      There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had looked around him and satisfied himself that nothing had been taken
      away or moved. The room, for that matter, contained no knick-knack of any
      value, no important paper that might have explained the woman&rsquo;s visit,
      followed by her sudden disappearance. And yet why that inexplicable
      flight?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one telephoned?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one letter by the last post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put it on your mantel-piece, governor, as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin&rsquo;s bedroom was next to the drawing-room, but Lupin had permanently
      bolted the door between the two. He, therefore, had to go through the hall
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin switched on the electric light and, the next moment, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... I put it next to the flower-bowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be looking in the wrong place, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Achille moved the bowl, lifted the clock, bent down to the grate, in
      vain: the letter was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh blast it, blast it!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s done it... she&rsquo;s taken it...
      And then, when she had the letter, she cleared out... Oh, the slut!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad! There&rsquo;s no way through between the two rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who did take it, governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both of them silent. Lupin strove to control his anger and
      collect his ideas. He asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you look at the envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything particular about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it looked as if it had been written in a hurry, or scribbled,
      rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was the address worded?... Do you remember?&rdquo; asked Lupin, in a voice
      strained with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remembered it, because it struck me as funny...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But speak, will you? Speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It said, &lsquo;Monsieur de Beaumont, Michel.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin took his servant by the shoulders and shook him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It said &lsquo;de&rsquo; Beaumont? Are you sure? And &lsquo;Michel&rsquo; after &lsquo;Beaumont&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; muttered Lupin, with a choking throat. &ldquo;It was a letter from
      Gilbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless, a little pale, with drawn features. There was no
      doubt about it: the letter was from Gilbert. It was the form of address
      which, by Lupin&rsquo;s orders, Gilbert had used for years in corresponding with
      him. Gilbert had at last&mdash;after long waiting and by dint of endless
      artifices&mdash;found a means of getting a letter posted from his prison
      and had hastily written to him. And now the letter was intercepted! What
      did it say? What instructions had the unhappy prisoner given? What help
      was he praying for? What stratagem did he suggest?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin looked round the room, which, contrary to the drawing-room,
      contained important papers. But none of the locks had been forced; and he
      was compelled to admit that the woman had no other object than to get hold
      of Gilbert&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constraining himself to keep his temper, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the letter come while the woman was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time. The porter rang at the same moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could she see the envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion was evident. It remained to discover how the visitor had
      been able to effect her theft. By slipping from one window to the other,
      outside the flat? Impossible: Lupin found the window of his room shut. By
      opening the communicating door? Impossible: Lupin found it locked and
      barred with its two inner bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, a person cannot pass through a wall by a mere operation of
      will. To go in or out of a room requires a passage; and, as the act was
      accomplished in the space of a few minutes, it was necessary, in the
      circumstances, that the passage should be previously in existence, that it
      should already have been contrived in the wall and, of course, known to
      the woman. This hypothesis simplified the search by concentrating it upon
      the door; for the wall was quite bare, without a cupboard, chimney-piece
      or hangings of any kind, and unable to conceal the least outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin went back to the drawing-room and prepared to make a study of the
      door. But he at once gave a start. He perceived, at the first glance, that
      the left lower panel of the six small panels contained within the
      cross-bars of the door no longer occupied its normal position and that the
      light did not fall straight upon it. On leaning forward, he saw two little
      tin tacks sticking out on either side and holding the panel in place,
      similar to a wooden board behind a picture-frame. He had only to shift
      these. The panel at once came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Achille gave a cry of amazement. But Lupin objected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? And what then? We are no better off than before. Here is an empty
      oblong, eight or nine inches wide by sixteen inches high. You&rsquo;re not going
      to pretend that a woman can slip through an opening which would not admit
      the thinnest child of ten years old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but she can have put her arm through and drawn the bolts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bottom bolt, yes,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;But the top bolt, no: the distance is
      far too great. Try for yourself and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Achille tried and had to give up the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not reply. He stood thinking for a long time. Then, suddenly, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my hat... my coat...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried off, urged by an imperative idea. And, the moment he reached
      the street, he sprang into a taxi:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue Matignon, quick!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they came to the house where he had been robbed of the crystal
      stopper, he jumped out of the cab, opened his private entrance, went
      upstairs, ran to the drawing-room, turned on the light and crouched at the
      foot of the door leading to his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had guessed right. One of the little panels was loosened in the same
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, just as in his other flat in the Rue Chateaubriand, the opening was
      large enough to admit a man&rsquo;s arm and shoulder, but not to allow him to
      draw the upper bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang!&rdquo; he shouted, unable any longer to master the rage that had been
      seething within him for the last two hours. &ldquo;Blast! Shall I never have
      finished with this confounded business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, an incredible ill-luck seemed to dog his footsteps, compelling
      him to grope about at random, without permitting him to use the elements
      of success which his own persistency or the very force of things placed
      within his grasp. Gilbert gave him the crystal stopper. Gilbert sent him a
      letter. And both had disappeared at that very moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was not, as he had until then believed, a series of fortuitous and
      independent circumstances. No, it was manifestly the effect of an adverse
      will pursuing a definite object with prodigious ability and incredible
      boldness, attacking him, Lupin, in the recesses of his safest retreats and
      baffling him with blows so severe and so unexpected that he did not even
      know against whom he had to defend himself. Never, in the course of his
      adventures, had he encountered such obstacles as now.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, little by little, deep down within himself, there grew a haunting
      dread of the future. A date loomed before his eyes, the terrible date
      which he unconsciously assigned to the law to perform its work of
      vengeance, the date upon which, in the light of a wan April morning, two
      men would mount the scaffold, two men who had stood by him, two comrades
      whom he had been unable to save from paying the awful penalty...

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE HOME LIFE OF ALEXIS DAUBRECQ
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Daubrecq the deputy came in from lunch on the day after the police
      had searched his house he was stopped by Clemence, his portress, who told
      him that she had found a cook who could be thoroughly relied on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook arrived a few minutes later and produced first-rate characters,
      signed by people with whom it was easy to take up her references. She was
      a very active woman, although of a certain age, and agreed to do the work
      of the house by herself, without the help of a man-servant, this being a
      condition upon which Daubrecq insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last place was with a member of the Chamber of Deputies, Comte
      Saulevat, to whom Daubrecq at once telephoned. The count&rsquo;s steward gave
      her a perfect character, and she was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had fetched her trunk, she set to work and cleaned and
      scrubbed until it was time to cook the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq dined and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock, after the portress had gone to bed, the cook cautiously
      opened the garden-gate. A man came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I, Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took him to her bedroom on the third floor, overlooking the garden,
      and at once burst into lamentations:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More of your tricks and nothing but tricks! Why can&rsquo;t you leave me alone,
      instead of sending me to do your dirty work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it, you dear old Victoire? [*] When I want a person of
      respectable appearance and incorruptible morals, I think of you. You ought
      to be flattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See The Hollow Needle by Maurice Leblanc, translated by
     Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, and later volumes of the Lupin
     series.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you care about me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You run me into danger once
      more; and you think it&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you risking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, what am I risking? All my characters are false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Characters are always false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose M. Daubrecq finds out? Suppose he makes inquiries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has made inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has telephoned to the steward of Comte Saulevat, in whose service you
      say that you have had the honour of being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see, I&rsquo;m done for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The count&rsquo;s steward could not say enough in your praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know him. I got him his situation with Comte Saulevat. So you
      understand...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victoire seemed to calm down a little:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done... or rather yours. And what do you
      expect me to do in all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, to put me up. You were my wet-nurse once. You can very well give
      me half your room now. I&rsquo;ll sleep in the armchair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next? To supply me with such food as I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next? To undertake, with me and under my direction, a regular series of
      searches with a view...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To discovering the precious object of which I spoke to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crystal stopper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crystal stopper... Saints above! A nice business! And, if we don&rsquo;t find
      your confounded stopper, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin took her gently by the arm and, in a serious voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find it, Gilbert, young Gilbert whom you know and love, will
      stand every chance of losing his head; and so will Vaucheray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaucheray I don&rsquo;t mind... a dirty rascal like him! But Gilbert...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen the papers this evening? Things are looking worse than
      ever. Vaucheray, as might be expected, accuses Gilbert of stabbing the
      valet; and it so happens that the knife which Vaucheray used belonged to
      Gilbert. That came out this morning. Whereupon Gilbert, who is intelligent
      in his way, but easily frightened, blithered and launched forth into
      stories and lies which will end in his undoing. That&rsquo;s how the matter
      stands. Will you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth, for several days, Lupin moulded his existence upon
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s, beginning his investigations the moment the deputy left the
      house. He pursued them methodically, dividing each room into sections
      which he did not abandon until he had been through the tiniest nooks and
      corners and, so to speak, exhausted every possible device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victoire searched also. And nothing was forgotten. Table-legs,
      chair-rungs, floor-boards, mouldings, mirror- and picture-frames, clocks,
      plinths, curtain-borders, telephone-holders and electric fittings:
      everything that an ingenious imagination could have selected as a
      hiding-place was overhauled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they also watched the deputy&rsquo;s least actions, his most unconscious
      movements, the expression of his face, the books which he read and the
      letters which he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy enough. He seemed to live his life in the light of day. No
      door was ever shut. He received no visits. And his existence worked with
      mechanical regularity. He went to the Chamber in the afternoon, to the
      club in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;there must be something that&rsquo;s not orthodox behind
      all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing of the sort,&rdquo; moaned Victoire. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your time
      and we shall be bowled out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the detectives and their habit of walking up and down
      outside the windows drove her mad. She refused to admit that they were
      there for any other purpose than to trap her, Victoire. And, each time
      that she went shopping, she was quite surprised that one of those men did
      not lay his hand upon her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she returned all upset. Her basket of provisions was shaking on
      her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear Victoire?&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green? I dare say I do. So would you look green...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had to sit down and it was only after making repeated efforts that she
      succeeded in stuttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man... a man spoke to me... at the fruiterer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jingo! Did he want you to run away with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he gave me a letter...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you complaining about? It was a love-letter, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for your governor,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;My governor?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;for the gentleman who&rsquo;s staying in your room.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time, Lupin had started:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it here,&rdquo; he said, snatching the letter from her. The envelope bore
      no address. But there was another, inside it, on which he read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Monsieur Arsene Lupin,
     c/o Victoire.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a bit thick!&rdquo; He tore open the second
      envelope. It contained a sheet of paper with the following words, written
      in large capitals:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Everything you are doing is useless and dangerous... Give it up.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Victoire uttered one moan and fainted. As for Lupin, he felt himself blush
      up to his eyes, as though he had been grossly insulted. He experienced all
      the humiliation which a duellist would undergo if he heard the most secret
      advice which he had received from his seconds repeated aloud by a mocking
      adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he held his tongue. Victoire went back to her work. As for him,
      he remained in his room all day, thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he did not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he kept saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of thinking? I am up against one of those problems which
      are not solved by any amount of thought. It is certain that I am not alone
      in the matter and that, between Daubrecq and the police, there is, in
      addition to the third thief that I am, a fourth thief who is working on
      his own account, who knows me and who reads my game clearly. But who is
      this fourth thief? And am I mistaken, by any chance? And... oh, rot!...
      Let&rsquo;s get to sleep!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he could not sleep; and a good part of the night went in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning he seemed to hear a noise in the house. He
      jumped up quickly and, from the top of the staircase, saw Daubrecq go down
      the first flight and turn toward the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later, after opening the gate, the deputy returned with a man
      whose head was buried in an enormous fur collar and showed him into his
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin had taken his precautions in view of any such contingency. As the
      windows of the study and those of his bedroom, both of which were at the
      back of the house, overlooked the garden, he fastened a rope-ladder to his
      balcony, unrolled it softly and let himself down by it until it was level
      with the top of the study windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      These windows were closed by shutters; but, as they were bowed, there
      remained a semi-circular space at the top; and Lupin, though he could not
      hear, was able to see all that went on inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then realized that the person whom he had taken for a man was a woman:
      a woman who was still young, though her dark hair was mingled with gray; a
      tall woman, elegantly but quite unobtrusively dressed, whose handsome
      features bore the expression of weariness and melancholy which long
      suffering gives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the deuce have I seen her before?&rdquo; Lupin asked himself. &ldquo;For I
      certainly know that face, that look, that expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood leaning against the table, listening impassively to Daubrecq,
      who was also standing and who was talking very excitedly. He had his back
      turned to Lupin; but Lupin, leaning forward, caught sight of a glass in
      which the deputy&rsquo;s image was reflected. And he was startled to see the
      strange look in his eyes, the air of fierce and brutal desire with which
      Daubrecq was staring at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to embarrass her too, for she sat down with lowered lids. Then
      Daubrecq leant over her and it appeared as though he were ready to fling
      his long arms, with their huge hands, around her. And, suddenly, Lupin
      perceived great tears rolling down the woman&rsquo;s sad face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not it was the sight of those tears that made Daubrecq lose his
      head, with a brusque movement he clutched the woman and drew her to him.
      She repelled him, with a violence full of hatred. And, after a brief
      struggle, during which Lupin caught a glimpse of the man&rsquo;s bestial and
      contorted features, the two of them stood face to face, railing at each
      other like mortal enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they stopped. Daubrecq sat down. There was mischief in his face, and
      sarcasm as well. And he began to talk again, with sharp taps on the table,
      as though he were dictating terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She no longer stirred. She sat haughtily in her chair and towered over
      him, absent-minded, with roaming eyes. Lupin, captivated by that powerful
      and sorrowful countenance, continued to watch her; and he was vainly
      seeking to remember of what or of whom she reminded him, when he noticed
      that she had turned her head slightly and that she was imperceptibly
      moving her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her arm strayed farther and farther and her hand crept along the table
      and Lupin saw that, at the end of the table, there stood a water-bottle
      with a gold-topped stopper. The hand reached the water-bottle, felt it,
      rose gently and seized the stopper. A quick movement of the head, a
      glance, and the stopper was put back in its place. Obviously, it was not
      what the woman hoped to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it!&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s after the crystal stopper too! The matter is
      becoming more complicated daily; there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, on renewing his observation of the visitor, he was astounded to note
      the sudden and unexpected expression of her countenance, a terrible,
      implacable, ferocious expression. And he saw that her hand was continuing
      its stealthy progress round the table and that, with an uninterrupted and
      crafty sliding movement, it was pushing back books and, slowly and surely,
      approaching a dagger whose blade gleamed among the scattered papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gripped the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq went on talking. Behind his back, the hand rose steadily, little
      by little; and Lupin saw the woman&rsquo;s desperate and furious eyes fixed upon
      the spot in the neck where she intended to plant the knife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a very silly thing, fair lady,&rdquo; thought Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he already began to turn over in his mind the best means of escaping
      and of taking Victoire with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, however, with uplifted arm. But it was only a momentary
      weakness. She clenched her teeth. Her whole face, contracted with hatred,
      became yet further convulsed. And she made the dread movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant Daubrecq crouched and, springing from his seat, turned
      and seized the woman&rsquo;s frail wrist in mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, he addressed no reproach to her, as though the deed which
      she had attempted surprised him no more than any ordinary, very natural
      and simple act. He shrugged his shoulders, like a man accustomed to that
      sort of danger, and strode up and down in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had dropped the weapon and was now crying, holding her head between
      her hands, with sobs that shook her whole frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next came up to her and said a few words, once more tapping the table
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a sign in the negative and, when he insisted, she, in her turn,
      stamped her foot on the floor and exclaimed, loud enough for Lupin to
      hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!... Never!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, without another word, Daubrecq fetched the fur cloak which she
      had brought with her and hung it over the woman&rsquo;s shoulders, while she
      shrouded her face in a lace wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he showed her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later, the garden-gate was locked again. &ldquo;Pity I can&rsquo;t run
      after that strange person,&rdquo; thought Lupin, &ldquo;and have a chat with her about
      the Daubrecq bird. Seems to me that we two could do a good stroke of
      business together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In any case, there was one point to be cleared up: Daubrecq the deputy,
      whose life was so orderly, so apparently respectable, was in the habit of
      receiving visits at night, when his house was no longer watched by the
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent Victoire to arrange with two members of his gang to keep watch for
      several days. And he himself remained awake next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As on the previous morning, he heard a noise at four o&rsquo;clock. As on the
      previous morning, the deputy let some one in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin ran down his ladder and, when he came to the free space above the
      shutters, saw a man crawling at Daubrecq&rsquo;s feet, flinging his arms round
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s knees in frenzied despair and weeping, weeping convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq, laughing, pushed him away repeatedly, but the man clung to him.
      He behaved almost like one out of his mind and, at last, in a genuine fit
      of madness, half rose to his feet, took the deputy by the throat and flung
      him back in a chair. Daubrecq struggled, powerless at first, while his
      veins swelled in his temples. But soon, with a strength far beyond the
      ordinary, he regained the mastery and deprived his adversary of all power
      of movement. Then, holding him with one hand, with the other he gave him
      two great smacks in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man got up, slowly. He was livid and could hardly stand on his legs.
      He waited for a moment, as though to recover his self-possession. Then,
      with a terrifying calmness, he drew a revolver from his pocket and
      levelled it at Daubrecq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq did not flinch. He even smiled, with a defiant air and without
      displaying more excitement than if he had been aimed at with a toy pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stood for perhaps fifteen or twenty seconds, facing his enemy,
      with outstretched arm. Then, with the same deliberate slowness, revealing
      a self-control which was all the more impressive because it followed upon
      a fit of extreme excitement, he put up his revolver and, from another
      pocket, produced his note-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man opened the pocketbook. A sheaf of banknotes appeared in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq seized and counted them. They were thousand-franc notes, and
      there were thirty of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked on, without a movement of revolt, without a protest. He
      obviously understood the futility of words. Daubrecq was one of those who
      do not relent. Why should his visitor waste time in beseeching him or even
      in revenging himself upon him by uttering vain threats and insults? He had
      no hope of striking that unassailable enemy. Even Daubrecq&rsquo;s death would
      not deliver him from Daubrecq.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning Victoire, on returning from her shopping,
      handed Lupin a note from his accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened it and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who came to see Daubrecq last night is Langeroux the deputy,
      leader of the independent left. A poor man, with a large family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;Daubrecq is nothing more nor less than a blackmailer;
      but, by Jupiter, he has jolly effective ways of going to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Events tended to confirm Lupin&rsquo;s supposition. Three days later he saw
      another visitor hand Daubrecq an important sum of money. And, two days
      after that, one came and left a pearl necklace behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first was called Dachaumont, a senator and ex-cabinet-minister. The
      second was the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex, a Bonapartist deputy, formerly chief
      political agent in France of Prince Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene, in each of these cases, was very similar to Langeroux the
      deputy&rsquo;s interview, a violent tragic scene, ending in Daubrecq&rsquo;s victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so on and so forth,&rdquo; thought Lupin, when he received these
      particulars. &ldquo;I have been present at four visits. I shall know no more if
      there are ten, or twenty, or thirty... It is enough for me to learn the
      names of the visitors from my friends on sentry-go outside. Shall I go and
      call on them?... What for? They have no reason to confide in me... On the
      other hand, am I to stay on here, delayed by investigations which lead to
      nothing and which Victoire can continue just as well without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very much perplexed. The news of the inquiry into the case of
      Gilbert and Vaucheray was becoming worse and worse, the days were slipping
      by, and not an hour passed without his asking himself, in anguish, whether
      all his efforts&mdash;granting that he succeeded&mdash;would not end in
      farcical results, absolutely foreign to the aim which he was pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, after all, supposing that he did fathom Daubrecq&rsquo;s underhand
      dealings, would that give him the means of rescuing Gilbert and Vaucheray?
    </p>
    <p>
      That day an incident occurred which put an end to his indecision. After
      lunch Victoire heard snatches of a conversation which Daubrecq held with
      some one on the telephone. Lupin gathered, from what Victoire reported,
      that the deputy had an appointment with a lady for half-past eight and
      that he was going to take her to a theatre:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall get a pit-tier box, like the one we had six weeks ago,&rdquo; Daubrecq
      had said. And he added, with a laugh, &ldquo;I hope that I shall not have the
      burglars in during that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a doubt in Lupin&rsquo;s mind. Daubrecq was about to spend his
      evening in the same manner in which he had spent the evening six weeks
      ago, while they were breaking into his villa at Enghien. To know the
      person whom he was to meet and perhaps thus to discover how Gilbert and
      Vaucheray had learnt that Daubrecq would be away from eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening until one o&rsquo;clock in the morning: these were matters of the utmost
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin left the house in the afternoon, with Victoire&rsquo;s assistance. He knew
      through her that Daubrecq was coming home for dinner earlier than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his flat in the Rue Chateaubriand, telephoned for three of his
      friends, dressed and made himself up in his favourite character of a
      Russian prince, with fair hair and moustache and short-cut whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accomplices arrived in a motor-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, Achille, his man, brought him a telegram, addressed to M.
      Michel Beaumont, Rue Chateaubriand, which ran:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Do not come to theatre this evening.  Danger of your
  intervention spoiling everything.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was a flower-vase on the chimney-piece beside him. Lupin took it and
      smashed it to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;They are playing with me as I usually
      play with others. Same behaviour. Same tricks. Only there&rsquo;s this
      difference...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What difference? He hardly knew. The truth was that he too was baffled and
      disconcerted to the inmost recesses of his being and that he was
      continuing to act only from obstinacy, from a sense of duty, so to speak,
      and without putting his ordinary good humour and high spirits into the
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said to his accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his instructions, the chauffeur set them down near the Square
      Lamartine, but kept the motor going. Lupin foresaw that Daubrecq, in order
      to escape the detectives watching the house, would jump into the first
      taxi; and he did not intend to be outdistanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not allowed for Daubrecq&rsquo;s cleverness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven both leaves of the garden-gate were flung open, a
      bright light flashed and a motor-cycle darted across the road, skirted the
      square, turned in front of the motor-car and shot away toward the Bois at
      a speed so great that they would have been mad to go in pursuit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Daisy!&rdquo; said Lupin, trying to jest, but really overcome with
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He eyed his accomplices in the hope that one of them would venture to give
      a mocking smile. How pleased he would have been to vent his nerves on
      them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; he said to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave them some dinner; then he smoked a cigar and they set off again in
      the car and went the round of the theatres, beginning with those which
      were giving light operas and musical comedies, for which he presumed that
      Daubrecq and his lady would have a preference. He took a stall, inspected
      the lower-tier boxes and went away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next drove to the more serious theatres: the Renaissance, the Gymnase.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, he saw a pit-tier box at the
      Vaudeville almost entirely protected from inspection by its two screens;
      and, on tipping the boxkeeper, was told that it contained a short, stout,
      elderly gentleman and a lady who was wearing a thick lace veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next box was free. He took it, went back to his friends to give them
      their instructions and sat down near the couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the entr&rsquo;acte, when the lights went up, he perceived Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      profile. The lady remained at the back of the box, invisible. The two were
      speaking in a low voice; and, when the curtain rose again, they went on
      speaking, but in such a way that Lupin could not distinguish a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes passed. Some one tapped at their door. It was one of the men
      from the box-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you M. le Depute Daubrecq, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Daubrecq, in a voice of surprise. &ldquo;But how do you know my
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman asking for you on the telephone. He told me to go to
      Box 22.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to say, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming... I&rsquo;m coming...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq rose hurriedly from his seat and followed the clerk to the
      box-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not yet out of sight when Lupin sprang from his box, worked the
      lock of the next door and sat down beside the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a stifled cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have to speak to you. It is most important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, between her teeth. &ldquo;Arsene Lupin!&rdquo; He was dumbfounded. For
      a moment he sat quiet, open-mouthed. The woman knew him! And not only did
      she know him, but she had recognized him through his disguise! Accustomed
      though he was to the most extraordinary and unusual events, this
      disconcerted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not even dream of protesting and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know?... So you know?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched at the lady&rsquo;s veil and pulled it aside before she had time to
      defend herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he muttered, with increased amazement. &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the woman whom he had seen at Daubrecq&rsquo;s a few days earlier, the
      woman who had raised her dagger against Daubrecq and who had intended to
      stab him with all the strength of her hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her turn to be taken aback:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Have you seen me before?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the other night, at his house... I saw what you tried to do...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a movement to escape. He held her back and, speaking with great
      eagerness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know who you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was why I had Daubrecq
      telephoned for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked aghast:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say it was not the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was one of my assistants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Daubrecq will come back?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we have time... Listen to me... We must meet again... He is your
      enemy... I will save you from him...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you? What is your object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not distrust me... it is quite certain that our interests are
      identical... Where can I see you? To-morrow, surely? At what time? And
      where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with obvious hesitation, not knowing what to do, on the
      point of speaking and yet full of uneasiness and doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I entreat you... answer me just one word... and at once... It would
      be a pity for him to find me here... I entreat you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name doesn&rsquo;t matter... We will see each other first and you shall
      explain to me... Yes, we will meet... Listen, to-morrow, at three o&rsquo;clock,
      at the corner of the Boulevard...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that exact moment, the door of the box opened, so to speak, with a
      bang, and Daubrecq appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; Lupin mumbled, under his breath, furious at being caught before
      obtaining what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq gave a chuckle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it... I thought something was up... Ah, the telephone-trick: a
      little out of date, sir! I had not gone half-way when I turned back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed Lupin to the front of the box and, sitting down beside the lady,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, now my lord, who are we? A servant at the police-office, probably?
      There&rsquo;s a professional look about that mug of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared hard at Lupin, who did not move a muscle, and tried to put a
      name to the face, but failed to recognize the man whom he had called
      Polonius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, without taking his eyes from Daubrecq either, reflected. He would
      not for anything in the world have thrown up the game at that point or
      neglected this favourable opportunity of coming to an understanding with
      his mortal enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman sat in her corner, motionless, and watched them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go outside, sir. That will make our interview easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord, here,&rdquo; grinned the deputy. &ldquo;It will take place here,
      presently, during the entr&rsquo;acte. Then we shall not be disturbing anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save your breath, my man; you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t budge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took Lupin by the coat-collar, with the obvious intention of not
      letting go of him before the interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rash move! Was it likely that Lupin would consent to remain in such an
      attitude, especially before a woman, a woman to whom he had offered his
      alliance, a woman&mdash;and he now thought of it for the first time&mdash;who
      was distinctly good-looking and whose grave beauty attracted him. His
      whole pride as a man rose at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he said nothing. He accepted the heavy weight of the hand on his
      shoulder and even sat bent in two, as though beaten, powerless, almost
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, clever!&rdquo; said the deputy, scoffingly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to be swaggering
      quite so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stage was full of actors who were arguing and making a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had loosened his grasp slightly and Lupin felt that the moment
      had come. With the edge of his hand, he gave him a violent blow in the
      hollow of the arm, as he might have done with a hatchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pain took Daubrecq off his guard. Lupin now released himself entirely
      and sprang at the other to clutch him by the throat. But Daubrecq had at
      once put himself on the defensive and stepped back and their four hands
      seized one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gripped with superhuman energy, the whole force of the two
      adversaries concentrating in those hands. Daubrecq&rsquo;s were of monstrous
      size; and Lupin, caught in that iron vise, felt as though he were fighting
      not with a man, but with some terrible beast, a huge gorilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      They held each other against the door, bending low, like a pair of
      wrestlers groping and trying to lay hold of each other. Their bones
      creaked. Whichever gave way first was bound to be caught by the throat and
      strangled. And all this happened amid a sudden silence, for the actors on
      the stage were now listening to one of their number, who was speaking in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stood back flat against the partition, looking at them in
      terror. Had she taken sides with either of them, with a single movement,
      the victory would at once have been decided in that one&rsquo;s favour. But
      which of them should she assist? What could Lupin represent in her eyes? A
      friend? An enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      She briskly made for the front of the box, forced back the screen and,
      leaning forward, seemed to give a signal. Then she returned and tried to
      slip to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, as though wishing to help her, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you move the chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking of a heavy chair which had fallen down between him and
      Daubrecq and across which they were struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stooped and pulled away the chair. That was what Lupin was
      waiting for. Once rid of the obstacle, he caught Daubrecq a smart kick on
      the shin with the tip of his patent-leather boot. The result was the same
      as with the blow which he had given him on the arm. The pain caused a
      second&rsquo;s apprehension and distraction, of which he at once took advantage
      to beat down Daubrecq&rsquo;s outstretched hands and to dig his ten fingers into
      his adversary&rsquo;s throat and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq struggled. Daubrecq tried to pull away the hands that were
      throttling him; but he was beginning to choke and felt his strength
      decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, you old monkey!&rdquo; growled Lupin, forcing him to the floor. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
      you shout for help? How frightened you must be of a scandal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the fall there came a knocking at the partition, on the
      other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knock away, knock away,&rdquo; said Lupin, under his breath. &ldquo;The play is on
      the stage. This is my business and, until I&rsquo;ve mastered this gorilla...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not take him long. The deputy was choking. Lupin stunned him with a
      blow on the jaw; and all that remained for him to do was to take the woman
      away and make his escape with her before the alarm was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when he turned round, he saw that the woman was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not be far. Darting from the box, he set off at a run,
      regardless of the programme-sellers and check-takers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the entrance-lobby, he saw her through an open door, crossing
      the pavement of the Chaussee d&rsquo;Antin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was stepping into a motor-car when he came up with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the handle and tried to pull at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a man jumped up inside and sent his fist flying into Lupin&rsquo;s face,
      with less skill but no less force than Lupin had sent his into Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stunned though he was by the blow, he nevertheless had ample time to
      recognize the man, in a sudden, startled vision, and also to recognize,
      under his chauffeur&rsquo;s disguise, the man who was driving the car. It was
      the Growler and the Masher, the two men in charge of the boats on the
      Enghien night, two friends of Gilbert and Vaucheray: in short, two of
      Lupin&rsquo;s own accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached his rooms in the Rue Chateaubriand, Lupin, after washing
      the blood from his face, sat for over an hour in a chair, as though
      overwhelmed. For the first time in his life he was experiencing the pain
      of treachery. For the first time his comrades in the fight were turning
      against their chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically, to divert his thoughts, he turned to his correspondence and
      tore the wrapper from an evening paper. Among the late news he found the
      following paragraphs:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;THE VILLA MARIE-THERESE CASE&rdquo;
 
      &ldquo;The real identity of Vaucheray, one of the alleged
 murderers of Leonard the valet, has at last been ascertained.
 He is a miscreant of the worst type, a hardened criminal who
 has already twice been sentenced for murder, in default, under
 another name.

 &ldquo;No doubt, the police will end by also discovering the real name
 of his accomplice, Gilbert.  In any event, the examining-magistrate
 is determined to commit the prisoners for trial as soon as possible.

 &ldquo;The public will have no reason to complain of the delays of the law.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In between other newspapers and prospectuses lay a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin jumped when he saw it. It was addressed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Monsieur de Beaumont, Michel.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;a letter from Gilbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It contained these few words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Help, governor!... I am frightened. I am frightened...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Once again, Lupin spent a night alternating between sleeplessness and
      nightmares. Once again, he was tormented by atrocious and terrifying
      visions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE CHIEF OF THE ENEMIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; murmured Lupin, when his eyes fell on Gilbert&rsquo;s letter next
      morning. &ldquo;How he must feel it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the very first day when he saw him, he had taken a liking to that
      well-set-up youngster, so careless, gay and fond of life. Gilbert was
      devoted to him, would have accepted death at a sign from his master. And
      Lupin also loved his frankness, his good humour, his simplicity, his
      bright, open face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; he often used to say, &ldquo;you are an honest man. Do you know, if I
      were you, I should chuck the business and become an honest man for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you, governor,&rdquo; Gilbert would reply, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, governor. An honest man is a chap who works and grinds. It&rsquo;s a taste
      which I may have had as a nipper; but they&rsquo;ve made me lose it since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was silent. He was always silent when questioned about his early
      life; and all that Lupin knew was that he had been an orphan since
      childhood and that he had lived all over the place, changing his name and
      taking up the queerest jobs. The whole thing was a mystery which no one
      had been able to fathom; and it did not look as though the police would
      make much of it either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, on the other hand, did it look as though the police would consider
      that mystery a reason for delaying proceedings. They would send
      Vaucheray&rsquo;s accomplice for trial&mdash;under his name of Gilbert or any
      other name&mdash;and visit him with the same inevitable punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; repeated Lupin. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re persecuting him like this only
      because of me. They are afraid of his escaping and they are in a hurry to
      finish the business: the verdict first and then... the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the butchers!... A lad of twenty, who has committed no murder, who is
      not even an accomplice in the murder...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas, Lupin well knew that this was a thing impossible to prove and that
      he must concentrate his efforts upon another point. But upon which? Was he
      to abandon the trail of the crystal stopper?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not make up his mind to that. His one and only diversion from the
      search was to go to Enghien, where the Growler and the Masher lived, and
      make sure that nothing had been seen of them since the murder at the Villa
      Marie-Therese. Apart from this, he applied himself to the question of
      Daubrecq and nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused even to trouble his head about the problems set before him: the
      treachery of the Growler and the Masher; their connection with the
      gray-haired lady; the spying of which he himself was the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Lupin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One only argues falsely in a fever. So hold
      your tongue. No inferences, above all things! Nothing is more foolish than
      to infer one fact from another before finding a certain starting-point.
      That&rsquo;s where you get up a tree. Listen to your instinct. Act according to
      your instinct. And as you are persuaded, outside all argument, outside all
      logic, one might say, that this business turns upon that confounded
      stopper, go for it boldly. Have at Daubrecq and his bit of crystal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not wait to arrive at these conclusions before settling his
      actions accordingly. At the moment when he was stating them in his mind,
      three days after the scene at the Vaudeville, he was sitting, dressed like
      a retired tradesman, in an old overcoat, with a muffler round his neck, on
      a bench in the Avenue Victor-Hugo, at some distance from the Square
      Lamartine. Victoire had his instructions to pass by that bench at the same
      hour every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated to himself, &ldquo;the crystal stopper: everything turns on
      that... Once I get hold of it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victoire arrived, with her shopping-basket on her arm. He at once noticed
      her extraordinary agitation and pallor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Lupin, walking beside his old nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into a big grocer&rsquo;s, which was crowded with people, and, turning
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, in a voice torn with excitement. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve
      been hunting for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, taking something from her basket, she gave it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin stood astounded: in his hand lay the crystal stopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be true? Can it be true?&rdquo; he muttered, as though the ease of the
      solution had thrown him off his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact remained, visible and palpable. He recognized by its shape,
      by its size, by the worn gilding of its facets, recognized beyond any
      possible doubt the crystal stopper which he had seen before. He even
      remarked a tiny, hardly noticeable little scratch on the stem which he
      remembered perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, while the thing presented all the same characteristics, it
      possessed no other that seemed out of the way. It was a crystal stopper,
      that was all. There was no really special mark to distinguish it from
      other stoppers. There was no sign upon it, no stamp; and, being cut from a
      single piece, it contained no foreign object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lupin received a quick insight into the depth of his mistake. What
      good could the possession of that crystal stopper do him so long as he was
      ignorant of its value? That bit of glass had no existence in itself; it
      counted only through the meaning that attached to it. Before taking it,
      the thing was to be certain. And how could he tell that, in taking it, in
      robbing Daubrecq of it, he was not committing an act of folly?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a question which was impossible of solution, but which forced
      itself upon him with singular directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No blunders!&rdquo; he said to himself, as he pocketed the stopper. &ldquo;In this
      confounded business, blunders are fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not taken his eyes off Victoire. Accompanied by a shopman, she went
      from counter to counter, among the throng of customers. She next stood for
      some little while at the pay-desk and passed in front of Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whispered her instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet me behind the Lycee Janson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She joined him in an unfrequented street:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I&rsquo;m followed?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I looked carefully. Listen to me. Where did you find
      the stopper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the drawer of the table by his bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we had felt there already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I did so again this morning. I expect he put it there last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I expect he&rsquo;ll want to take it from there again,&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose he finds it gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victoire looked frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;If he finds it gone, he&rsquo;ll accuse you of taking
      it, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go and put it back, as fast as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t have had time to find
      out. Give it to me, quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in the pocket of his overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Victoire, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, upon my word, it&rsquo;s gone... somebody&rsquo;s taken it from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst into a peal of laughter, a laughter which, this time, was free
      from all bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victoire flew out at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh away!... Putting me in such a predicament!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help laughing? You must confess that it&rsquo;s funny. It&rsquo;s no longer
      a tragedy that we&rsquo;re acting, but a fairy-tale, as much a fairy-tale as
      Puss in Boots or Jack and the Beanstalk. I must write it when I get a few
      weeks to myself: The Magic Stopper; or, The Mishaps of Poor Arsene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well... who has taken it from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?... It has flown away... vanished from my
      pocket: hey presto, begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave the old servant a gentle push and, in a more serious tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home, Victoire, and don&rsquo;t upset yourself. Of course, some one saw you
      give me the stopper and took advantage of the crowd in the shop to pick my
      pocket of it. That only shows that we are watched more closely than I
      thought and by adversaries of the first rank. But, once more, be easy.
      Honest men always come by their own... Have you anything else to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Some one came yesterday evening, while M. Daubrecq was out. I saw
      lights reflected upon the trees in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The portress&rsquo; bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The portress was up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was some of those detective-fellows; they are still hunting. I&rsquo;ll
      see you later, Victoire. You must let me in again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You want to...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I risk? Your room is on the third floor. Daubrecq suspects
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others? If it was to their interest to play me a trick, they&rsquo;d have
      tried before now. I&rsquo;m in their way, that&rsquo;s all. They&rsquo;re not afraid of me.
      So till later, Victoire, at five o&rsquo;clock exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One further surprise awaited Lupin. In the evening his old nurse told him
      that, having opened the drawer of the bedside table from curiosity, she
      had found the crystal stopper there again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin was no longer to be excited by these miraculous incidents. He simply
      said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s been brought back. And the person who brought it back and who
      enters this house by some unexplained means considered, as I did, that the
      stopper ought not to disappear. And yet Daubrecq, who knows that he is
      being spied upon to his very bedroom, has once more left the stopper in a
      drawer, as though he attached no importance to it at all! Now what is one
      to make of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Lupin did not make anything of it, nevertheless he could not escape
      certain arguments, certain associations of ideas that gave him the same
      vague foretaste of light which one receives on approaching the outlet of a
      tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is inevitable, as the case stands,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that there must soon
      be an encounter between myself and the others. From that moment I shall be
      master of the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five days passed, during which Lupin did not glean the slightest
      particular. On the sixth day Daubrecq received a visit, in the small
      hours, from a gentleman, Laybach the deputy, who, like his colleagues,
      dragged himself at his feet in despair and, when all was done, handed him
      twenty thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more days; and then, one night, posted on the landing of the second
      floor, Lupin heard the creaking of a door, the front-door, as he
      perceived, which led from the hall into the garden. In the darkness he
      distinguished, or rather divined, the presence of two persons, who climbed
      the stairs and stopped on the first floor, outside Daubrecq&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were they doing there? It was not possible to enter the room, because
      Daubrecq bolted his door every night. Then what were they hoping?
    </p>
    <p>
      Manifestly, a handiwork of some kind was being performed, as Lupin
      discovered from the dull sounds of rubbing against the door. Then words,
      uttered almost beneath a whisper, reached him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite, but, all the same, we&rsquo;d better put it off till to-morrow,
      because...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not hear the end of the sentence. The men were already groping
      their way downstairs. The hall-door was closed, very gently, and then the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious, say what one likes,&rdquo; thought Lupin. &ldquo;Here is a house in
      which Daubrecq carefully conceals his rascalities and is on his guard, not
      without good reason, against spies; and everybody walks in and out as in a
      booth at a fair. Victoire lets me in, the portress admits the emissaries
      of the police: that&rsquo;s well and good; but who is playing false in these
      people&rsquo;s favour? Are we to suppose that they are acting alone? But what
      fearlessness! And how well they know their way about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, during Daubrecq&rsquo;s absence, he examined the door of the
      first-floor bedroom. And, at the first glance, he understood: one of the
      lower panels had been skilfully cut out and was only held in place by
      invisible tacks. The people, therefore, who had done this work were the
      same who had acted at his two places, in the Rue Matignon and the Rue
      Chateaubriand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also found that the work dated back to an earlier period and that, as
      in his case, the opening had been prepared beforehand, in anticipation of
      favourable circumstances or of some immediate need.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day did not seem long to Lupin. Knowledge was at hand. Not only would
      he discover the manner in which his adversaries employed those little
      openings, which were apparently unemployable, since they did not allow a
      person to reach the upper bolts, but he would learn who the ingenious and
      energetic adversaries were with whom he repeatedly and inevitably found
      himself confronted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One incident annoyed him. In the evening Daubrecq, who had complained of
      feeling tired at dinner, came home at ten o&rsquo;clock and, contrary to his
      usual custom, pushed the bolts of the hall-door. In that case, how would
      the others be able to carry out their plan and go to Daubrecq&rsquo;s room?
      Lupin waited for an hour after Daubrecq put out his light. Then he went
      down to the deputy&rsquo;s study, opened one of the windows ajar and returned to
      the third floor and fixed his rope-ladder so that, in case of need, he
      could reach the study without passing though the house. Lastly, he resumed
      his post on the second-floor landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not have to wait long. An hour earlier than on the previous night
      some one tried to open the hall-door. When the attempt failed, a few
      minutes of absolute silence followed. And Lupin was beginning to think
      that the men had abandoned the idea, when he gave a sudden start. Some one
      had passed, without the least sound to interrupt the silence. He would not
      have known it, so utterly were the thing&rsquo;s steps deadened by the
      stair-carpet, if the baluster-rail, which he himself held in his hand, had
      not shaken slightly. Some one was coming upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as the ascent continued, Lupin became aware of the uncanny feeling
      that he heard nothing more than before. He knew, because of the rail, that
      a thing was coming and he could count the number of steps climbed by
      noting each vibration of the rail; but no other indication gave him that
      dim sensation of presence which we feel in distinguishing movements which
      we do not see, in perceiving sounds which we do not hear. And yet a
      blacker darkness ought to have taken shape within the darkness and
      something ought, at least, to modify the quality of the silence. No, he
      might well have believed that there was no one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lupin, in spite of himself and against the evidence of his reason,
      ended by believing it, for the rail no longer moved and he thought that he
      might have been the sport of an illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this lasted a long time. He hesitated, not knowing what to do, not
      knowing what to suppose. But an odd circumstance impressed him. A clock
      struck two. He recognized the chime of Daubrecq&rsquo;s clock. And the chime was
      that of a clock from which one is not separated by the obstacle of a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin slipped down the stairs and went to the door. It was closed, but
      there was a space on the left, at the bottom, a space left by the removal
      of the little panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened. Daubrecq, at that moment, turned in his bed; and his
      breathing was resumed, evenly and a little stertorously. And Lupin plainly
      heard the sound of rumpling garments. Beyond a doubt, the thing was there,
      fumbling and feeling through the clothes which Daubrecq had laid beside
      his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Lupin, &ldquo;we shall learn something. But how the deuce did the
      beggar get in? Has he managed to draw the bolts and open the door? But, if
      so, why did he make the mistake of shutting it again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not for a second&mdash;a curious anomaly in a man like Lupin, an anomaly
      to be explained only by the uncanny feeling which the whole adventure
      produced in him&mdash;not for a second did he suspect the very simple
      truth which was about to be revealed to him. Continuing his way down, he
      crouched on one of the bottom steps of the staircase, thus placing himself
      between the door of the bedroom and the hall-door, on the road which
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s enemy must inevitably take in order to join his accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He questioned the darkness with an unspeakable anguish. He was on the
      point of unmasking that enemy of Daubrecq&rsquo;s, who was also his own
      adversary. He would thwart his plans. And the booty captured from Daubrecq
      he would capture in his turn, while Daubrecq slept and while the
      accomplices lurking behind the hall-door or outside the garden-gate vainly
      awaited their leader&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that return took place. Lupin knew it by the renewed vibration of the
      balusters. And, once more, with every sense strained and every nerve on
      edge, he strove to discern the mysterious thing that was coming toward
      him. He suddenly realized it when only a few yards away. He himself,
      hidden in a still darker recess, could not be seen. And what he saw&mdash;in
      the very vaguest manner&mdash;was approaching stair by stair, with
      infinite precautions, holding on to each separate baluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom the devil have I to do with?&rdquo; said Lupin to himself, while his heart
      thumped inside his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophe was hastened. A careless movement on Lupin&rsquo;s part was
      observed by the stranger, who stopped short. Lupin was afraid lest the
      other should turn back and take to flight. He sprang at the adversary and
      was stupefied at encountering nothing but space and knocking against the
      stair-rail without seizing the form which he saw. But he at once rushed
      forward, crossed the best part of the hall and caught up his antagonist
      just as he was reaching the door opening on the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cry of fright, answered by other cries on the further side of
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; muttered Lupin, whose arms had closed, in the
      dark, round a little, tiny, trembling, whimpering thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly understanding, he stood for a moment motionless and dismayed, at
      a loss what to do with his conquered prey. But the others were shouting
      and stamping outside the door. Thereupon, dreading lest Daubrecq should
      wake up, he slipped the little thing under his jacket, against his chest,
      stopped the crying with his handkerchief rolled into a ball and hurried up
      the three flights of stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to Victoire, who woke with a start. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you the
      indomitable chief of our enemies, the Hercules of the gang. Have you a
      feeding-bottle about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down in the easy-chair a child of six or seven years of age, the
      tiniest little fellow in a gray jersey and a knitted woollen cap, whose
      pale and exquisitely pretty features were streaked with the tears that
      streamed from the terrified eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you pick that up?&rdquo; asked Victoire, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the foot of the stairs, as it was coming out of Daubrecq&rsquo;s bedroom,&rdquo;
       replied Lupin, feeling the jersey in the hope that the child had brought a
      booty of some kind from that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victoire was stirred to pity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little dear! Look, he&rsquo;s trying not to cry!... Oh, saints above, his
      hands are like ice! Don&rsquo;t be afraid, sonnie, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt you: the
      gentleman&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;the gentleman&rsquo;s quite all right, but there&rsquo;s another
      very wicked gentleman who&rsquo;ll wake up if they go on making such a rumpus
      outside the hall-door. Do you hear them, Victoire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The satellites of our young Hercules, the indomitable leader&rsquo;s gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well...?&rdquo; stammered Victoire, utterly unnerved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I don&rsquo;t want to be caught in the trap, I shall start by clearing
      out. Are you coming, Hercules?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rolled the child in a blanket, so that only its head remained outside,
      gagged its mouth as gently as possible and made Victoire fasten it to his
      shoulders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Hercules? We&rsquo;re having a game. You never thought you&rsquo;d find
      gentlemen to play pick-a-back with you at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning!
      Come, whoosh, let&rsquo;s fly away! You don&rsquo;t get giddy, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped across the window-ledge and set foot on one of the rungs of the
      ladder. He was in the garden in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never ceased hearing and now heard more plainly still the blows
      that were being struck upon the front-door. He was astounded that Daubrecq
      was not awakened by so violent a din:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t put a stop to this, they&rsquo;ll spoil everything,&rdquo; he said to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in an angle of the house, invisible in the darkness, and measured
      the distance between himself and the gate. The gate was open. To his
      right, he saw the steps, on the top of which the people were flinging
      themselves about; to his left, the building occupied by the portress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman had come out of her lodge and was standing near the people,
      entreating them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do be quiet, do be quiet! He&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;The good woman is an accomplice of these as well.
      By Jingo, what a pluralist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed across to her and, taking her by the scruff of the neck, hissed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell them I&rsquo;ve got the child... They can come and fetch it at my
      place, Rue Chateaubriand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little way off, in the avenue, stood a taxi which Lupin presumed to be
      engaged by the gang. Speaking authoritatively, as though he were one of
      the accomplices, he stepped into the cab and told the man to drive him
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to the child, &ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t much of a shake-up, was it?...
      What do you say to going to bye-bye on the gentleman&rsquo;s bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As his servant, Achille, was asleep, Lupin made the little chap
      comfortable and stroked his hair for him. The child seemed numbed. His
      poor face was as though petrified into a stiff expression made up, at one
      and the same time, of fear and the wish not to show fear, of the longing
      to scream and a pitiful effort not to scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry, my pet, cry,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do you good to cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child did not cry, but the voice was so gentle and so kind that he
      relaxed his tense muscles; and, now that his eyes were calmer and his
      mouth less contorted, Lupin, who was examining him closely, found
      something that he recognized, an undoubted resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This again confirmed certain facts which he suspected and which he had for
      some time been linking in his mind. Indeed, unless he was mistaken, the
      position was becoming very different and he would soon assume the
      direction of events. After that...
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring at the bell followed, at once, by two others, sharp ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Lupin to the child. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s mummy come to fetch you. Don&rsquo;t
      move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman entered, wildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;My son! Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my room,&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without asking more, thus proving that she knew the way, she rushed to the
      bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I thought,&rdquo; muttered Lupin. &ldquo;The youngish woman with the gray hair:
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s friend and enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the window and looked through the curtains. Two men were
      striding up and down the opposite pavement: the Growler and the Masher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re not even hiding themselves,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
      good sign. They consider that they can&rsquo;t do without me any longer and that
      they&rsquo;ve got to obey the governor. There remains the pretty lady with the
      gray hair. That will be more difficult. It&rsquo;s you and I now, mummy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found the mother and the boy clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms; and the
      mother, in a great state of alarm, her eyes moist with tears, was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt? You&rsquo;re sure? Oh, how frightened you must have been, my
      poor little Jacques!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine little fellow,&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply. She was feeling the child&rsquo;s jersey, as Lupin had done,
      no doubt to see if he had succeeded in his nocturnal mission; and she
      questioned him in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mummy,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;No, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him fondly and petted him, until, in a little while, the child,
      worn out with fatigue and excitement, fell asleep. She remained leaning
      over him for a long time. She herself seemed very much worn out and in
      need of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not disturb her contemplation. He looked at her anxiously, with
      an attention which she did not perceive, and he noticed the wider rings
      round her eyes and the deeper marks of wrinkles. Yet he considered her
      handsomer than he had thought, with that touching beauty which habitual
      suffering gives to certain faces that are more human, more sensitive than
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore so sad an expression that, in a burst of instinctive sympathy, he
      went up to her and said: &ldquo;I do not know what your plans are, but, whatever
      they may be, you stand in need of help. You cannot succeed alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two men outside? I know them. They&rsquo;re no good. I beseech you, make
      use of me. You remember the other evening, at the theatre, in the private
      box? You were on the point of speaking. Do not hesitate to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes on him, looked at him long and fixedly and, as though
      unable to escape that opposing will, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know exactly? What do you know about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many things that I do not know. I do not know your name. But I
      know...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him with a gesture; and, resolutely, in her turn,
      dominating the man who was compelling her to speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What you know, after all, is not much
      and is of no importance. But what are your plans? You offer me your help:
      with what view? For what work? You have flung yourself headlong into this
      business; I have been unable to undertake anything without meeting you on
      my path: you must be contemplating some aim... What aim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What aim? Upon my word, it seems to me that my conduct...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, emphatically, &ldquo;no phrases! What you and I want is
      certainties; and, to achieve them, absolute frankness. I will set you the
      example. M. Daubrecq possesses a thing of unparalleled value, not in
      itself, but for what it represents. That thing you know. You have twice
      held it in your hands. I have twice taken it from you. Well, I am entitled
      to believe that, when you tried to obtain possession of it, you meant to
      use the power which you attribute to it and to use it to your own
      advantage...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you meant to use it to forward your schemes, in the interest of your
      own affairs, in accordance with your habits as a...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a burglar and a swindler,&rdquo; said Lupin, completing the sentence for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not protest. He tried to read her secret thoughts in the depths of
      her eyes. What did she want with him? What was she afraid of? If she
      mistrusted him, had he not also reasons to mistrust that woman who had
      twice taken the crystal stopper from him to restore it to Daubrecq? Mortal
      enemy of Daubrecq&rsquo;s though she were, up to what point did she remain
      subject to that man&rsquo;s will? By surrendering himself to her, did he not
      risk surrendering himself to Daubrecq? And yet he had never looked upon
      graver eyes nor a more honest face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further hesitation, he stated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My object is simple enough. It is the release of my friends Gilbert and
      Vaucheray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true? Is that true?&rdquo; she exclaimed, quivering all over and
      questioning him with an anxious glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know you... I know who you are. For months, I have taken part in
      your life, without your suspecting it... and yet, for certain reasons, I
      still doubt...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said, in a more decisive tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know me. If you knew me, you would know that there can be no
      peace for me before my two companions have escaped the awful fate that
      awaits them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rushed at him, took him by the shoulders and positively distraught,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What did you say? The awful fate?... Then you believe... you
      believe...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really believe,&rdquo; said Lupin, who felt how greatly this threat upset
      her, &ldquo;I really believe that, if I am not in time, Gilbert and Vaucheray
      are done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet!... Be quiet!&rdquo; she cried, clutching him fiercely. &ldquo;Be quiet!...
      You mustn&rsquo;t say that... There is no reason... It&rsquo;s just you who
      suppose...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only I, it&rsquo;s Gilbert as well...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Gilbert? How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from Gilbert, who has no hope left but in me; from Gilbert, who
      knows that only one man in the world can save him and who, a few days ago,
      sent me a despairing appeal from prison. Here is his letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She snatched the paper greedily and read in stammering accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help, governor!... I am frightened!... I am frightened!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the letter. Her hands fluttered in space. It was as though her
      staring eyes beheld the sinister vision which had already so often
      terrified Lupin. She gave a scream of horror, tried to rise and fainted.

      CHAPTER V. THE TWENTY-SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The child was sleeping peacefully on the bed. The mother did not move from
      the sofa on which Lupin had laid her; but her easier breathing and the
      blood which was now returning to her face announced her impending recovery
      from her swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He observed that she wore a wedding-ring. Seeing a locket hanging from her
      bodice, he stooped and, turning it, found a miniature photograph
      representing a man of about forty and a lad&mdash;a stripling rather&mdash;in
      a schoolboy&rsquo;s uniform. He studied the fresh, young face set in curly hair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as I thought,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah, poor woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand which he took between his grew warmer by degrees. The eyes
      opened, then closed again. She murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not distress yourself... it&rsquo;s all right he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recovered consciousness entirely. But, as she did not speak, Lupin put
      questions to her, to make her feel a gradual need of unbosoming herself.
      And he said, pointing to the locket:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The schoolboy is Gilbert, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gilbert is your son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a shiver and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gilbert is my son, my eldest son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she was the mother of Gilbert, of Gilbert the prisoner at the Sante,
      relentlessly pursued by the authorities and now awaiting his trial for
      murder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other portrait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he died three years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was now sitting up. Life quivered in her veins once more, together
      with the horror of living and the horror of all the ghastly things that
      threatened her. Lupin went on to ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was your husband&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victorien Mergy the deputy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Lupin remembered the incident and the stir which
      it had caused. Three years ago, Mergy the deputy had blown out his brains
      in the lobby of the Chamber, without leaving a word of explanation behind
      him; and no one had ever discovered the slightest reason for that suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the reason?&rdquo; asked Lupin, completing his thought aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Gilbert had disappeared for some years, turned out of doors and
      cursed by my husband. It was a very great sorrow, but there was another
      motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not necessary for Lupin to put further questions. Madame Mergy
      could keep silent no longer and, slowly at first, with all the anguish of
      that past which had to be called up, she told her story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five years ago, when my name was Clarisse Darcel and my parents
      living, I knew three young men at Nice. Their names will at once give you
      an insight into the present tragedy: they were Alexis Daubrecq, Victorien
      Mergy and Louis Prasville. The three were old acquaintances, had gone to
      college in the same year and served in the same regiment. Prasville, at
      that time, was in love with a singer at the opera-house at Nice. The two
      others, Mergy and Daubrecq, were in love with me. I shall be brief as
      regards all this and, for the rest, as regards the whole story, for the
      facts tell their own tale. I fell in love with Victorien Mergy from the
      first. Perhaps I was wrong not to declare myself at once. But true love is
      always timid, hesitating and shy; and I did not announce my choice until I
      felt quite certain and quite free. Unfortunately, that period of waiting,
      so delightful for those who cherish a secret passion, had permitted
      Daubrecq to hope. His anger was something horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse Mergy stopped for a few seconds and resumed, in a stifled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget it... The three of us were in the drawing-room. Oh,
      I can hear even now the terrible words of threat and hatred which he
      uttered! Victorien was absolutely astounded. He had never seen his friend
      like this, with that repugnant face, that bestial expression: yes, the
      expression of a wild beast... Daubrecq ground his teeth. He stamped his
      feet. His bloodshot eyes&mdash;he did not wear spectacles in those days&mdash;rolled
      in their sockets; and he kept on saying, &lsquo;I shall be revenged ... I shall
      be revenged... Oh, you don&rsquo;t know what I am capable of!... I shall wait
      ten years, twenty years, if necessary... But it will come like a
      thunderbolt... Ah, you don&rsquo;t know!... To be revenged... To do harm... for
      harm&rsquo;s sake... what joy! I was born to do harm... And you will both
      beseech my mercy on your knees, on your knees, yes, on your knees...&rsquo; At
      that moment, my father entered the room; and, with his assistance and the
      footman&rsquo;s, Victorien Mergy flung the loathsome creature out of doors. Six
      weeks later, I married Victorien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Daubrecq?&rdquo; asked Lupin, interrupting her. &ldquo;Did he not try...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but on our wedding-day, Louis Prasville, who acted as my husband&rsquo;s
      best man in defiance of Danbrecq&rsquo;s opposition, went home to find the girl
      he loved, the opera-singer, dead, strangled...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Lupin, with a start. &ldquo;Had Daubrecq...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was known that Daubrecq had been persecuting her with his attentions
      for some days; but nothing more was known. It was impossible to discover
      who had gone in or out during Prasville&rsquo;s absence. There was not a trace
      found of any kind: nothing, absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Prasville...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no doubt of the truth in Prasville&rsquo;s mind or ours. Daubrecq had
      tried to run away with the girl, perhaps tried to force her, to hustle her
      and, in the course of the struggle, maddened, losing his head, caught her
      by the throat and killed her, perhaps without knowing what he was doing.
      But there was no evidence of all this; and Daubrecq was not even
      molested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of him next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some years we heard nothing of him. We knew only that he had lost all
      his money gambling and that he was travelling in America. And, in spite of
      myself, I forgot his anger and his threats and was only too ready to
      believe that he had ceased to love me and no longer harboured his schemes
      of revenge. Besides, I was so happy that I did not care to think of
      anything but my happiness, my love, my husband&rsquo;s political career, the
      health of my son Antoine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antoine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Antoine is Gilbert&rsquo;s real name. The unhappy boy has at least
      succeeded in concealing his identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin asked, with some hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what period did... Gilbert... begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you exactly. Gilbert&mdash;I prefer to call him that and
      not to pronounce his real name&mdash;Gilbert, as a child, was what he is
      to-day: lovable, liked by everybody, charming, but lazy and unruly. When
      he was fifteen, we put him to a boarding-school in one of the suburbs,
      with the deliberate object of not having him too much at home. After two
      years&rsquo; time he was expelled from school and sent back to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of his conduct. The masters had discovered that he used to slip
      out at night and also that he would disappear for weeks at a time, while
      pretending to be at home with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What used he to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amuse himself backing horses, spending his time in cafes and public
      dancing-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he had money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave it him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His evil genius, the man who, secretly, unknown to his parents, enticed
      him away from school, the man who led him astray, who corrupted him, who
      took him from us, who taught him to lie, to waste his substance and to
      steal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse Mergy put her hands together to hide the blushes on her forehead.
      She continued, in her tired voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq had taken his revenge. On the day after my husband turned our
      unhappy child out of the house, Daubrecq sent us a most cynical letter in
      which he revealed the odious part which he had played and the machinations
      by which he had succeeded in depraving our son. And he went on to say,
      &lsquo;The reformatory, one of these days... Later on, the assize-court ... And
      then, let us hope and trust, the scaffold!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Did Daubrecq plot the present business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, that is only an accident. The hateful prophecy was just a wish
      which he expressed. But oh, how it terrified me! I was ailing at the time;
      my other son, my little Jacques, had just been born. And every day we
      heard of some fresh misdeed of Gilbert&rsquo;s&mdash;forgeries, swindles&mdash;so
      much so that we spread the news, in our immediate surroundings, of his
      departure for abroad, followed by his death. Life was a misery; and it
      became still more so when the political storm burst in which my husband
      was to meet his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word will be enough: my husband&rsquo;s name was on the list of the
      Twenty-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The veil was suddenly lifted from Lupin&rsquo;s eyes and he saw, as in a flash
      of lightning, a whole legion of things which, until then, had been hidden
      in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse Mergy continued, in a firmer voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his name was on it, but by mistake, by a piece of incredible
      ill-luck of which he was the victim. It is true that Victorien Mergy was a
      member of the committee appointed to consider the question of the Two-Seas
      Canal. It is true that he voted with the members who were in favour of the
      company&rsquo;s scheme. He was even paid&mdash;yes, I tell you so plainly and I
      will mention the sum&mdash;he was paid fifteen thousand francs. But he was
      paid on behalf of another, of one of his political friends, a man in whom
      he had absolute confidence and of whom he was the blind, unconscious tool.
      He thought he was showing his friend a kindness; and it proved his own
      undoing. It was not until the day after the suicide of the chairman of the
      company and the disappearance of the secretary, the day on which the
      affair of the canal was published in the papers, with its whole series of
      swindles and abominations, that my husband knew that a number of his
      fellow-members had been bribed and learnt that the mysterious list, of
      which people suddenly began to speak, mentioned his name with theirs and
      with the names of other deputies, leaders of parties and influential
      politicians. Oh, what awful days those were! Would the list be published?
      Would his name come out? The torture of it! You remember the mad
      excitement in the Chamber, the atmosphere of terror and denunciation that
      prevailed. Who owned the list? Nobody could say. It was known to be in
      existence and that was all. Two names were sacrificed to public odium. Two
      men were swept away by the storm. And it remained unknown where the
      denunciation came from and in whose hands the incriminating documents
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq,&rdquo; suggested Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Madame Mergy. &ldquo;Daubrecq was nothing at that time: he had
      not yet appeared upon the scene. No, don&rsquo;t you remember, the truth came
      out suddenly through the very man who was keeping it back: Germineaux, the
      ex-minister of justice, a cousin of the chairman of the Canal Company. As
      he lay dying of consumption, he wrote from his sick-bed to the prefect of
      police, bequeathing him that list of names, which, he said, would be
      found, after his death, in an iron chest in the corner of his room. The
      house was surrounded by police and the prefect took up his quarters by the
      sick man&rsquo;s bedside. Germineaux died. The chest was opened and found to be
      empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq, this time,&rdquo; Lupin declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Daubrecq,&rdquo; said Madame Mergy, whose excitement was momentarily
      increasing. &ldquo;Alexis Daubrecq, who, for six months, disguised beyond
      recognition, had acted as Germineaux&rsquo;s secretary. It does not matter how
      he discovered that Germineaux was the possessor of the paper in question.
      The fact remains that he broke open the chest on the night before the
      death. So much was proved at the inquiry; and Daubrecq&rsquo;s identity was
      established.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was not arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would have been the use? They knew well enough that he must have
      deposited the list in a place of safety. His arrest would have involved a
      scandal, the reopening of the whole case...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they made terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin laughed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny, making terms with Daubrecq!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very funny,&rdquo; said Madame Mergy, bitterly. &ldquo;During this time he acted
      and without delay, shamelessly, making straight for the goal. A week after
      the theft, he went to the Chamber of Deputies, asked for my husband and
      bluntly demanded thirty thousand francs of him, to be paid within
      twenty-four hours. If not, he threatened him with exposure and disgrace.
      My husband knew the man he was dealing with, knew him to be implacable and
      filled with relentless hatred. He lost his head and shot himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; Lupin could not help saying. &ldquo;How absurd! Daubrecq possesses
      a list of twenty-seven names. To give up any one of those names he is
      obliged, if he would have his accusation believed, to publish the list
      itself&mdash;that is to say, to part with the document, or at least a
      photograph of it. Well, in so doing, he creates a scandal, it is true, but
      he deprives himself, at the same time, of all further means of levying
      blackmail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through Daubrecq himself. The villain came to see me and cynically told
      me of his interview with my husband and the words that had passed between
      them. Well, there is more than that list, more than that famous bit of
      paper on which the secretary put down the names and the amounts paid and
      to which, you will remember, the chairman of the company, before dying,
      affixed his signature in letters of blood. There is more than that. There
      are certain less positive proofs, which the people interested do not know
      of: the correspondence between the chairman and the secretary, between the
      chairman and his counsel, and so on. Of course, the list scribbled on the
      bit of paper is the only evidence that counts; it is the one incontestable
      proof which it would be no good copying or even photographing, for its
      genuineness can be tested most absolutely. But, all the same, the other
      proofs are dangerous. They have already been enough to do away with two
      deputies. And Daubrecq is marvelously clever at turning this fact to
      account. He selects his victim, frightens him out of his senses, points
      out to him the inevitable scandal; and the victim pays the required sum.
      Or else he kills himself, as my husband did. Do you understand now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in the silence that followed, he drew a mental picture of Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      life. He saw him the owner of that list, using his power, gradually
      emerging from the shadow, lavishly squandering the money which he extorted
      from his victims, securing his election as a district-councillor and
      deputy, holding sway by dint of threats and terror, unpunished,
      invulnerable, unattackable, feared by the government, which would rather
      submit to his orders than declare war upon him, respected by the judicial
      authorities: so powerful, in a word, that Prasville had been appointed
      secretary-general of police, over the heads of all who had prior claims,
      for the sole reason that he hated Daubrecq with a personal hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you saw him again?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him again. I had to. My husband was dead, but his honour remained
      untouched. Nobody suspected the truth. In order at least to defend the
      name which he left me, I accepted my first interview with Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your first, yes, for there have been others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many others,&rdquo; she said, in a strained voice, &ldquo;yes, many others... at the
      theatre... or in the evening, at Enghien... or else in Paris, at night ...
      for I was ashamed to meet that man and I did not want people to know it...
      But it was necessary... A duty more imperative than any other commanded
      it: the duty of avenging my husband...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent over Lupin and, eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, revenge has been the motive of my conduct and the sole preoccupation
      of my life. To avenge my husband, to avenge my ruined son, to avenge
      myself for all the harm that he has done me: I had no other dream, no
      other object in life. That is what I wanted: to see that man crushed,
      reduced to poverty, to tears&mdash;as though he still knew how to cry!&mdash;sobbing
      in the throes of despair...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted his death,&rdquo; said Lupin, remembering the scene between them in
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not his death. I have often thought of it, I have even raised my arm
      to strike him, but what would have been the good? He must have taken his
      precautions. The paper would remain. And then there is no revenge in
      killing a man... My hatred went further than that... It demanded his ruin,
      his downfall; and, to achieve that, there was but one way: to cut his
      claws. Daubrecq, deprived of the document that gives him his immense
      power, ceases to exist. It means immediate bankruptcy and disaster...
      under the most wretched conditions. That is what I have sought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Daubrecq must have been aware of your intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. And, I assure you, those were strange meetings of ours: I
      watching him closely, trying to guess his secret behind his actions and
      his words, and he... he...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he,&rdquo; said Lupin, finishing Clarisse&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;lying in wait for the
      prey which he desires... for the woman whom he has never ceased to love...
      whom he loves... and whom he covets with all his might and with all his
      furious passion...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her head and said, simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange duel indeed was that which brought face to face those two beings
      separated by so many implacable things! How unbridled must Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      passion be for him to risk that perpetual threat of death and to introduce
      to the privacy of his house this woman whose life he had shattered! But
      also how absolutely safe he must feel himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your search ended... how?&rdquo; asked Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My search,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;long remained without fruit. You know the
      methods of investigation which you have followed and which the police have
      followed on their side. Well, I myself employed them, years before either
      of you did, and in vain. I was beginning to despair. Then, one day, when I
      had gone to see Daubrecq in his villa at Enghien, I picked up under his
      writing-table a letter which he had begun to write, crumpled up and thrown
      into the waste-paper-basket. It consisted of a few lines in bad English;
      and I was able to read this: &lsquo;Empty the crystal within, so as to leave a
      void which it is impossible to suspect.&rsquo; Perhaps I should not have
      attached to this sentence all the importance which it deserved, if
      Daubrecq, who was out in the garden, had not come running in and begun to
      turn out the waste-paper-basket, with an eagerness which was very
      significant. He gave me a suspicious look: &lsquo;There was a letter there,&rsquo; he
      said. I pretended not to understand. He did not insist, but his agitation
      did not escape me; and I continued my quest in this direction. A month
      later, I discovered, among the ashes in the drawing-room fireplace, the
      torn half of an English invoice. I gathered that a Stourbridge
      glass-blower, of the name of John Howard, had supplied Daubrecq with a
      crystal bottle made after a model. The word &lsquo;crystal&rsquo; struck me at once. I
      went to Stourbridge, got round the foreman of the glass-works and learnt
      that the stopper of this bottle had been hollowed out inside, in
      accordance with the instruction in the order, so as to leave a cavity, the
      existence of which would escape observation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin nodded his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing tallies beyond a doubt. Nevertheless, it did not seem to me,
      that, even under the gilt layer... And then the hiding-place would be very
      tiny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiny, but large enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;On my return from England, I went to
      the police-office to see Prasville, whose friendship for me had remained
      unchanged. I did not hesitate to tell him, first, the reasons which had
      driven my husband to suicide and, secondly, the object of revenge which I
      was pursuing. When I informed him of my discoveries, he jumped for joy;
      and I felt that his hatred for Daubrecq was as strong as ever. I learnt
      from him that the list was written on a slip of exceedingly thin
      foreign-post-paper, which, when rolled up into a sort of pellet, would
      easily fit into an exceedingly limited space. Neither he nor I had the
      least hesitation. We knew the hiding-place. We agreed to act independently
      of each other, while continuing to correspond in secret. I put him in
      touch with Clemence, the portress in the Square Lamartine, who was
      entirely devoted to me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But less so to Prasville,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;for I can prove that she betrays
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now perhaps, but not at the start; and the police searches were numerous.
      It was at that time, ten months ago, that Gilbert came into my life again.
      A mother never loses her love for her son, whatever he may do, whatever he
      may have done. And then Gilbert has such a way with him... well, you know
      him. He cried, kissed my little Jacques, his brother and I forgave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and, weary-voiced, with her eyes fixed on the floor,
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven that I had not forgiven him! Ah, if that hour could but
      return, how readily I should find the horrible courage to turn him away!
      My poor child... it was I who ruined him!...&rdquo; And, pensively, &ldquo;I should
      have had that or any sort of courage, if he had been as I pictured him to
      myself and as he himself told me that he had long been: bearing the marks
      of vice and dissipation, coarse, deteriorated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, though he was utterly changed in appearance, so much so that I could
      hardly recognize him, there was, from the point of view of&mdash;how shall
      I put it?&mdash;from the moral point of view, an undoubted improvement.
      You had helped him, lifted him; and, though his mode of life was hateful
      to me, nevertheless he retained a certain self-respect... a sort of
      underlying decency that showed itself on the surface once more... He was
      gay, careless, happy... And he used to talk of you with such affection!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She picked her words, betraying her embarrassment, not daring, in Lupin&rsquo;s
      presence, to condemn the line of life which Gilbert had selected and yet
      unable to speak in favour of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo; asked Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him very often. He would come to me by stealth, or else I went to
      him and we would go for walks in the country. In this way, I was gradually
      induced to tell him our story, of his father&rsquo;s suicide and the object
      which I was pursuing. He at once took fire. He too wanted to avenge his
      father and, by stealing the crystal stopper, to avenge himself on Daubrecq
      for the harm which he had done him. His first idea&mdash;from which, I am
      bound to tell you, he never swerved&mdash;was to arrange with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; cried Lupin, &ldquo;he ought to have...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know... and I was of the same opinion. Unfortunately, my poor
      Gilbert&mdash;you know how weak he is!&mdash;was under the influence of
      one of his comrades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaucheray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Vaucheray, a saturnine spirit, full of bitterness and envy, an
      ambitious, unscrupulous, gloomy, crafty man, who had acquired a great
      empire over my son. Gilbert made the mistake of confiding in him and
      asking his advice. That was the origin of all the mischief. Vaucheray
      convinced him and convinced me as well that it would be better if we acted
      by ourselves. He studied the business, took the lead and finally organized
      the Enghien expedition and, under your direction, the burglary at the
      Villa Marie-Therese, which Prasville and his detectives had been unable to
      search thoroughly, because of the active watch maintained by Leonard the
      valet. It was a mad scheme. We ought either to have trusted in your
      experience entirely, or else to have left you out altogether, taking the
      risk of fatal mistakes and dangerous hesitations. But we could not help
      ourselves. Vaucheray ruled us. I agreed to meet Daubrecq at the theatre.
      During this time the thing took place. When I came home, at twelve o&rsquo;clock
      at night, I heard the terrible result: Leonard murdered, my son arrested.
      I at once received an intuition of the future. Daubrecq&rsquo;s appalling
      prophecy was being realized: it meant trial and sentence. And this through
      my fault, through the fault of me, the mother, who had driven my son
      toward the abyss from which nothing could extricate him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse wrung her hands and shivered from head to foot. What suffering
      can compare with that of a mother trembling for the head of her son?
      Stirred with pity, Lupin said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall save him. Of that there is not the shadow of a doubt. But, it is
      necessary that I should know all the details. Finish your story, please.
      How did you know, on the same night, what had happened at Enghien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She mastered herself and, with a face wrung with fevered anguish, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through two of your accomplices, or rather two accomplices of Vaucheray,
      to whom they were wholly devoted and who had chosen them to row the
      boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two men outside: the Growler and the Masher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. On your return from the villa, when you landed after being pursued
      on the lake by the commissary of police, you said a few words to them, by
      way of explanation, as you went to your car. Mad with fright, they rushed
      to my place, where they had been before, and told me the hideous news.
      Gilbert was in prison! Oh, what an awful night! What was I to do? Look for
      you? Certainly; and implore your assistance. But where was I to find
      you?... It was then that the two whom you call the Growler and the Masher,
      driven into a corner by circumstances, decided to tell me of the part
      played by Vaucheray, his ambitions, his plan, which had long been
      ripening...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get rid of me, I suppose?&rdquo; said Lupin, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. As Gilbert possessed your complete confidence, Vaucheray watched him
      and, in this way, got to know all the places which you live at. A few days
      more and, owning the crystal stopper, holding the list of the
      Twenty-seven, inheriting all Daubrecq&rsquo;s power, he would have delivered you
      to the police, without compromising a single member of your gang, which he
      looked upon as thenceforth his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ass!&rdquo; muttered Lupin. &ldquo;A muddler like that!&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;So the
      panels of the doors...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were cut out by his instructions, in anticipation of the contest on which
      he was embarking against you and against Daubrecq, at whose house he did
      the same thing. He had under his orders a sort of acrobat, an
      extraordinarily thin dwarf, who was able to wriggle through those
      apertures and who thus detected all your correspondence and all your
      secrets. That is what his two friends revealed to me. I at once conceived
      the idea of saving my elder son by making use of his brother, my little
      Jacques, who is himself so slight and so intelligent, so plucky, as you
      have seen. We set out that night. Acting on the information of my
      companions, I went to Gilbert&rsquo;s rooms and found the keys of your flat in
      the Rue Matignon, where it appeared that you were to sleep. Unfortunately,
      I changed my mind on the way and thought much less of asking for your help
      than of recovering the crystal stopper, which, if it had been discovered
      at Enghien, must obviously be at your flat. I was right in my
      calculations. In a few minutes, my little Jacques, who had slipped into
      your bedroom, brought it to me. I went away quivering with hope. Mistress
      in my turn of the talisman, keeping it to myself, without telling
      Prasville, I had absolute power over Daubrecq. I could make him do all
      that I wanted; he would become the slave of my will and, instructed by me,
      would take every step in Gilbert&rsquo;s favour and obtain that he should be
      given the means of escape or else that he should not be sentenced. It
      meant my boy&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse rose from her seat, with a passionate movement of her whole
      being, leant over Lupin and said, in a hollow voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing in that piece of crystal, nothing, do you understand?
      No paper, no hiding-place! The whole expedition to Enghien was futile! The
      murder of Leonard was useless! The arrest of my son was useless! All my
      efforts were useless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because what you stole from Daubrecq was not the stopper made by his
      instructions, but the stopper which was sent to John Howard, the
      Stourbridge glassworker, to serve as a model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Lupin had not been in the presence of so deep a grief, he could not
      have refrained from one of those satirical outbursts with which the
      mischievous tricks of fate are wont to inspire him. As it was, he muttered
      between his teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid! And still more stupid as Daubrecq had been given the
      warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I went to Enghien on the same day. In all that business
      Daubrecq saw and sees nothing but an ordinary burglary, an annexation of
      his treasures. The fact that you took part in it put him off the scent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, the disappearance of the stopper...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with, the thing can have had but a secondary importance for him,
      as it is only the model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a scratch at the bottom of the stem; and I have made inquiries
      in England since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; but why did the key of the cupboard from which it was stolen
      never leave the man-servant&rsquo;s possession? And why, in the second place,
      was it found afterward in the drawer of a table in Daubrecq&rsquo;s house in
      Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Daubrecq takes care of it and clings to it in the way in which
      one clings to the model of any valuable thing. And that is why I replaced
      the stopper in the cupboard before its absence was noticed. And that also
      is why, on the second occasion, I made my little Jacques take the stopper
      from your overcoat-pocket and told the portress to put it back in the
      drawer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he suspects nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. He knows that the list is being looked for, but he does not know
      that Prasville and I are aware of the thing in which he hides it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin had risen from his seat and was walking up and down the room,
      thinking. Then he stood still beside Clarisse and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When all is said, since the Enghien incident, you have not advanced a
      single step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one. I have acted from day to day, led by those two men or leading
      them, without any definite plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, at least,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without any other plan than that of getting the
      list of the Twenty-seven from Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but how? Besides, your tactics made things more difficult for me. It
      did not take us long to recognize your old servant Victoire in Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      new cook and to discover, from what the portress told us, that Victoire
      was putting you up in her room; and I was afraid of your schemes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you, was it not, who wrote to me to retire from the contest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You also asked me not to go to the theatre on the Vaudeville night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the portress caught Victoire listening to Daubrecq&rsquo;s conversation
      with me on the telephone; and the Masher, who was watching the house, saw
      you go out. I suspected, therefore, that you would follow Daubrecq that
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the woman who came here, late one afternoon...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was myself. I felt disheartened and wanted to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you intercepted Gilbert&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I recognized his writing on the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your little Jacques was not with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was outside, in a motor-car, with the Masher, who lifted him up to
      me through the drawing-room window; and he slipped into your bedroom
      through the opening in the panel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was in the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As ill-luck would have it, reproaches. Gilbert accused you of forsaking
      him, of taking over the business on your own account. In short, it
      confirmed me in my distrust; and I ran away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin shrugged his shoulders with irritation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shocking waste of time! And what a fatality that we were not able
      to come to an understanding earlier! You and I have been playing at
      hide-and-seek, laying absurd traps for each other, while the days were
      passing, precious days beyond repair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you see,&rdquo; she said, shivering, &ldquo;you too are afraid of the
      future!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not afraid,&rdquo; cried Lupin. &ldquo;But I am thinking of all the useful
      work that we could have done by this time, if we had united our efforts. I
      am thinking of all the mistakes and all the acts of imprudence which we
      should have been saved, if we had been working together. I am thinking
      that your attempt to-night to search the clothes which Daubrecq was
      wearing was as vain as the others and that, at this moment, thanks to our
      foolish duel, thanks to the din which we raised in his house, Daubrecq is
      warned and will be more on his guard than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse Mergy shook her head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t think that; the noise will not have roused him, for we
      postponed the attempt for twenty-four hours so that the portress might put
      a narcotic in his wine.&rdquo; And she added, slowly, &ldquo;And then, you see,
      nothing can make Daubrecq be more on his guard than he is already. His
      life is nothing but one mass of precautions against danger. He leaves
      nothing to chance... Besides, has he not all the trumps in his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin went up to her and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean to convey? According to you, is there nothing to hope
      for on that side? Is there not a single means of attaining our end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;there is one, one only...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He noticed her pallor before she had time to hide her face between her
      hands again. And again a feverish shiver shook her frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to understand the reason of her dismay; and, bending toward her,
      touched by her grief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please answer me openly and frankly. It&rsquo;s for
      Gilbert&rsquo;s sake, is it not? Though the police, fortunately, have not been
      able to solve the riddle of his past, though the real name of Vaucheray&rsquo;s
      accomplice has not leaked out, there is one man, at least, who knows it:
      isn&rsquo;t that so? Daubrecq has recognized your son Antoine, through the alias
      of Gilbert, has he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he promises to save him, doesn&rsquo;t he? He offers you his freedom, his
      release, his escape, his life: that was what he offered you, was it not,
      on the night in his study, when you tried to stab him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... yes... that was it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he makes one condition, does he not? An abominable condition, such as
      would suggest itself to a wretch like that? I am right, am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse did not reply. She seemed exhausted by her protracted struggle
      with a man who was gaining ground daily and against whom it was impossible
      for her to fight. Lupin saw in her the prey conquered in advance,
      delivered to the victor&rsquo;s whim. Clarisse Mergy, the loving wife of that
      Mergy whom Daubrecq had really murdered, the terrified mother of that
      Gilbert whom Daubrecq had led astray, Clarisse Mergy, to save her son from
      the scaffold, must, come what may and however ignominious the position,
      yield to Daubrecq&rsquo;s wishes. She would be the mistress, the wife, the
      obedient slave of Daubrecq, of that monster with the appearance and the
      ways of a wild beast, that unspeakable person of whom Lupin could not
      think without revulsion and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting down beside her, gently, with gestures of pity, he made her lift
      her head and, with his eyes on hers, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me. I swear that I will save your son: I swear it... Your son
      shall not die, do you understand?... There is not a power on earth that
      can allow your son&rsquo;s head to be touched as long as I am alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you... I trust your word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do. It is the word of a man who does not know defeat. I shall succeed.
      Only, I entreat you to make me an irrevocable promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not see Daubrecq again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must put from your mind any idea, any fear, however obscure, of an
      understanding between yourself and him... of any sort of bargain...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with an expression of absolute security and reliance;
      and he, under her gaze, felt the joy of devotion and an ardent longing to
      restore that woman&rsquo;s happiness, or, at least, to give her the peace and
      oblivion that heal the worst wounds:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, in a cheerful tone, rising from his chair, &ldquo;all will yet
      be well. We have two months, three months before us. It is more than I
      need... on condition, of course, that I am unhampered in my movements.
      And, for that, you will have to withdraw from the contest, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must disappear for a time; go and live in the country. Have you
      no pity for your little Jacques? This sort of thing would end by
      shattering the poor little man&rsquo;s nerves... And he has certainly earned his
      rest, haven&rsquo;t you, Hercules?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Clarisse Mergy, who was nearly breaking down under the strain
      of events and who herself needed repose, lest she should fall seriously
      ill, went, with her son, to board with a friend who had a house on the
      skirt of the Forest of Saint-Germain. She felt very weak, her brain was
      haunted by visions and her nerves were upset by troubles which the least
      excitement aggravated. She lived there for some days in a state of
      physical and mental inertia, thinking of nothing and forbidden to see the
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, while Lupin, changing his tactics, was working out a scheme
      for kidnapping and confining Daubrecq; while the Growler and the Masher,
      whom he had promised to forgive if he succeeded, were watching the enemy&rsquo;s
      movements; while the newspapers were announcing the forthcoming trial for
      murder of Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s two accomplices, one afternoon, at four o&rsquo;clock,
      the telephone-bell rang suddenly in the flat in the Rue Chateaubriand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin took down the receiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s voice, a breathless voice, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Michel Beaumont?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking to him, madame. To whom have I the honour...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, monsieur, come at once; Madame Mergy has taken poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not wait to hear details. He rushed out, sprang into his
      motor-car and drove to Saint-Germain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse&rsquo;s friend was waiting for him at the door of the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;she did not take sufficient. The doctor has just gone.
      He says she will get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did she make the attempt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her son Jacques has disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carried off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was playing just inside the forest. A motor-car was seen pulling
      up. Then there were screams. Clarisse tried to run, but her strength
      failed and she fell to the ground, moaning, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s he... it&rsquo;s that man...
      all is lost!&rsquo; She looked like a madwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly, she put a little bottle to her lips and swallowed the
      contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband and I carried her to her room. She was in great pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know my address, my name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From herself, while the doctor was attending to her. Then I telephoned to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one else been told?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nobody. I know that Clarisse has had terrible things to bear... and
      that she prefers not to be talked about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is asleep just now. And the doctor has forbidden all excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the doctor anxious about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is afraid of a fit of fever, any nervous strain, an attack of some
      kind which might cause her to make a fresh attempt on her life. And that
      would be...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is needed to avoid it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week or a fortnight of absolute quiet, which is impossible as long as
      her little Jacques...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin interrupted her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that, if she got her son back...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, there would be nothing more to fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure? You&rsquo;re sure?... Yes, of course you are!... Well, when Madame
      Mergy wakes, tell her from me that I will bring her back her son this
      evening, before midnight. This evening, before midnight: it&rsquo;s a solemn
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Lupin hurried out of the house and, stepping into his
      car, shouted to the driver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Paris, Square Lamartine, Daubrecq the deputy&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE DEATH-SENTENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lupin&rsquo;s motor-car was not only an office, a writing-room furnished with
      books, stationery, pens and ink, but also a regular actor&rsquo;s dressing-room,
      containing a complete make-up box, a trunk filled with every variety of
      wearing-apparel, another crammed with &ldquo;properties&rdquo;&mdash;umbrellas,
      walking-sticks, scarves, eye-glasses and so on&mdash;in short, a complete
      set of paraphernalia which enabled him to alter his appearance from top to
      toe in the course of a drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who rang at Daubrecq the deputy&rsquo;s gate, at six o-clock that
      evening, was a stout, elderly gentleman, in a black frock-coat, a bowler
      hat, spectacles and whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portress took him to the front-door of the house and rang the bell.
      Victoire appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can M. Daubrecq see Dr. Vernes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Daubrecq is in his bedroom; and it is rather late...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him my card, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote the words, &ldquo;From Mme. Mergy,&rdquo; in the margin and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, he is sure to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But...&rdquo; Victoire began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, drop your buts, old dear, do as I say, and don&rsquo;t make such a fuss
      about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was utterly taken aback and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!... is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Louis XIV!&rdquo; And, pushing her into a corner of the hall,
      &ldquo;Listen... The moment I&rsquo;m done with him, go up to your room, put your
      things together anyhow and clear out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I tell you. You&rsquo;ll find my car waiting down the avenue. Come, stir
      your stumps! Announce me. I&rsquo;ll wait in the study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s dark in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn on the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She switched on the electric light and left Lupin alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he reflected, as he took a seat, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s here that the crystal
      stopper lives... Unless Daubrecq always keeps it by him... But no, when
      people have a good hiding-place, they make use of it. And this is a
      capital one; for none of us... so far...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Concentrating all his attention, he examined the objects in the room; and
      he remembered the note which Daubrecq wrote to Prasville:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Within reach of your hand, my dear Prasville!...
  You touched it!  A little more and the trick was done...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed to have moved since that day. The same things were lying
      about on the desk: books, account-books, a bottle of ink, a stamp-box,
      pipes, tobacco, things that had been searched and probed over and over
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bounder!&rdquo; thought Lupin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s organized his business jolly cleverly.
      It&rsquo;s all dove-tailed like a well-made play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his heart of hearts, though he knew exactly what he had come to do and
      how he meant to act, Lupin was thoroughly aware of the danger and
      uncertainty attending his visit to so powerful an adversary. It was quite
      within the bounds of possibility that Daubrecq, armed as he was, would
      remain master of the field and that the conversation would take an
      absolutely different turn from that which Lupin anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this prospect angered him somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up, as he heard a sound of footsteps approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered without a word, made a sign to Lupin, who had risen from his
      chair, to resume his seat and himself sat down at the writing-desk.
      Glancing at the card which he held in his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Vernes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur le depute, Dr. Vernes, of Saint-Germain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I see that you come from Mme. Mergy. A patient of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A recent patient. I did not know her until I was called in to see her,
      the other day, in particularly tragic circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. Mergy has taken poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq gave a start and he continued, without concealing his distress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say? Poison! Is she dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the dose was not large enough. If no complications ensue, I consider
      that Mme. Mergy&rsquo;s life is saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq said nothing and sat silent, with his head turned to Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he looking at me? Are his eyes open or shut?&rdquo; Lupin asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It worried Lupin terribly not to see his adversary&rsquo;s eyes, those eyes
      hidden by the double obstacle of spectacles and black glasses: weak,
      bloodshot eyes, Mme. Mergy had told him. How could he follow the secret
      train of the man&rsquo;s thought without seeing the expression of his face? It
      was almost like fighting an enemy who wielded an invisible sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, Daubrecq spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mme. Mergy&rsquo;s life is saved... And she has sent you to me... I don&rsquo;t
      quite understand... I hardly know the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the ticklish moment,&rdquo; thought Lupin. &ldquo;Have at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in a genial, good-natured and rather shy tone, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur le depute, there are cases in which a doctor&rsquo;s duty becomes
      very complex... very puzzling... And you may think that, in taking this
      step... However, to cut a long story short, while I was attending Mme.
      Mergy, she made a second attempt to poison herself... Yes; the bottle,
      unfortunately, had been left within her reach. I snatched it from her. We
      had a struggle. And, railing in her fever, she said to me, in broken
      words, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the man... He&rsquo;s the man... Daubrecq the deputy... Make him
      give me back my son. Tell him to... or else I would rather die... Yes,
      now, to-night... I would rather die.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what she said, monsieur le
      depute... So I thought that I ought to let you know. It is quite certain
      that, in the lady&rsquo;s highly nervous state of mind... Of course, I don&rsquo;t
      know the exact meaning of her words... I asked no questions of anybody...
      obeyed a spontaneous impulse and came straight to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq reflected for a little while and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amounts to this, doctor, that you have come to ask me if I know the
      whereabouts of this child whom I presume to have disappeared. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, if I did happen to know, you would take him back to his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a longer pause. Lupin asked himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he by chance have swallowed the story? Is the threat of that death
      enough? Oh, nonsense it&rsquo;s out of the question!... And yet... and yet... he
      seems to be hesitating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse me?&rdquo; asked Daubrecq, drawing the telephone, on his
      writing-desk, toward him. &ldquo;I have an urgent message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monsieur le depute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!... 822.19, please, 822.19.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having repeated the number, he sat without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin smiled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The headquarters of police, isn&rsquo;t it? The secretary-general&rsquo;s office...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doctor... How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as a divisional surgeon, I sometimes have to ring them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, within himself, Lupin asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil does all this mean? The secretary-general is Prasville...
      Then, what?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq put both receivers to his ears and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you 822.19? I want to speak to M. Prasville, the secretary-general
      ... Do you say he&rsquo;s not there?... Yes, yes, he is: he&rsquo;s always in his
      office at this time... Tell him it&rsquo;s M. Daubrecq... M. Daubrecq the
      deputy... a most important communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m in the way?&rdquo; Lupin suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, doctor, not at all,&rdquo; said Daubrecq. &ldquo;Besides, what I have to
      say has a certain bearing on your errand.&rdquo; And, into the telephone,
      &ldquo;Hullo! M. Prasville?... Ah, it&rsquo;s you, Prasville, old cock!... Why, you
      seem quite staggered! Yes, you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s an age since you and I met.
      But, after all, we&rsquo;ve never been far away in thought... And I&rsquo;ve had
      plenty of visits from you and your henchmen... In my absence, it&rsquo;s true.
      Hullo!... What?... Oh, you&rsquo;re in a hurry? I beg your pardon!... So am I,
      for that matter... Well, to come to the point, there&rsquo;s a little service I
      want to do you... Wait, can&rsquo;t you, you brute?... You won&rsquo;t regret it... It
      concerns your renown... Hullo!... Are you listening?... Well, take
      half-a-dozen men with you... plain-clothes detectives, by preference:
      you&rsquo;ll find them at the night-office... Jump into a taxi, two taxis, and
      come along here as fast as you can... I&rsquo;ve got a rare quarry for you, old
      chap. One of the upper ten... a lord, a marquis Napoleon himself... in a
      word, Arsene Lupin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin sprang to his feet. He was prepared for everything but this. Yet
      something within him stronger than astonishment, an impulse of his whole
      nature, made him say, with a laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well done, well done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq bowed his head, by way of thanks, and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quite finished... A little patience, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; And he
      continued, &ldquo;Hullo! Prasville!... No, no, old chap, I&rsquo;m not humbugging...
      You&rsquo;ll find Lupin here, with me, in my study... Lupin, who&rsquo;s worrying me
      like the rest of you... Oh, one more or less makes no difference to me!
      But, all the same, this one&rsquo;s a bit too pushing. And I am appealing to
      your sense of kindness. Rid me of the fellow, do... Half-a-dozen of your
      satellites and the two who are pacing up and down outside my house will be
      enough... Oh, while you&rsquo;re about it, go up to the third floor and rope in
      my cook as well... She&rsquo;s the famous Victoire: you know, Master Lupin&rsquo;s old
      nurse... And, look here, one more tip, to show you how I love you: send a
      squad of men to the Rue Chateaubriand, at the corner of the Rue Balzac...
      That&rsquo;s where our national hero lives, under the name of Michel Beaumont...
      Do you twig, old cockalorum? And now to business. Hustle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Daubrecq turned his head, Lupin was standing up, with clenched fists.
      His burst of admiration had not survived the rest of the speech and the
      revelations which Daubrecq had made about Victoire and the flat in the Rue
      Chateaubriand. The humiliation was too great; and Lupin no longer bothered
      to play the part of the small general practitioner. He had but one idea in
      his head: not to give way to the tremendous fit of rage that was urging
      him to rush at Daubrecq like a bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq gave the sort of little cluck which, with him, did duty for a
      laugh. He came waddling up, with his hands in his trouser-pockets, and
      said, incisively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that this is all for the best? I&rsquo;ve cleared the ground,
      relieved the situation... At least, we now know where we stand. Lupin
      versus Daubrecq; and that&rsquo;s all about it. Besides, think of the time
      saved! Dr. Vernes, the divisional surgeon, would have taken two hours to
      spin his yarn! Whereas, like this, Master Lupin will be compelled to get
      his little story told in thirty minutes... unless he wants to get himself
      collared and his accomplices nabbed. What a shock! What a bolt from the
      blue! Thirty minutes and not a minute more. In thirty minutes from now,
      you&rsquo;ll have to clear out, scud away like a hare and beat a disordered
      retreat. Ha, ha, ha, what fun! I say, Polonius, you really are unlucky,
      each time you come up against Bibi Daubrecq! For it was you who were
      hiding behind that curtain, wasn&rsquo;t it, my ill-starred Polonius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not stir a muscle. The one and only solution that would have
      calmed his feelings, that is to say, for him to throttle his adversary
      then and there, was so absurd that he preferred to accept Daubrecq&rsquo;s gibes
      without attempting to retort, though each of them cut him like the lash of
      a whip. It was the second time, in the same room and in similar
      circumstances, that he had to bow before that Daubrecq of misfortune and
      maintain the most ridiculous attitude in silence. And he felt convinced in
      his innermost being that, if he opened his mouth, it would be to spit
      words of anger and insult in his victor&rsquo;s face. What was the good? Was it
      not essential that he should keep cool and do the things which the new
      situation called for?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. Lupin, well?&rdquo; resumed the deputy. &ldquo;You look as if your nose were
      out of joint. Come, console yourself and admit that one sometimes comes
      across a joker who&rsquo;s not quite such a mug as his fellows. So you thought
      that, because I wear spectacles and eye-glasses, I was blind? Bless my
      soul, I don&rsquo;t say that I at once suspected Lupin behind Polonius and
      Polonius behind the gentleman who came and bored me in the box at the
      Vaudeville. No, no! But, all the same, it worried me. I could see that,
      between the police and Mme. Mergy, there was a third bounder trying to get
      a finger in the pie. And, gradually, what with the words let fall by the
      portress, what with watching the movements of my cook and making inquiries
      about her in the proper quarter, I began to understand. Then, the other
      night, came the lightning-flash. I heard the row in the house, in spite of
      my being asleep. I managed to reconstruct the incident, to follow up Mme.
      Mergy&rsquo;s traces, first, to the Rue Chateaubriand and, afterward, to
      Saint-Germain... And then... what then? I put different facts together:
      the Enghien burglary... Gilbert&rsquo;s arrest... the inevitable treaty of
      alliance between the weeping mother and the leader of the gang... the old
      nurse installed as cook... all these people entering my house through the
      doors or through the windows... And I knew what I had to do. Master Lupin
      was sniffing at the secret. The scent of the Twenty-seven attracted him. I
      had only to wait for his visit. The hour has arrived. Good-evening, Master
      Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq paused. He had delivered his speech with the evident satisfaction
      of a man entitled to claim the appreciation of the most captious critics.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lupin did not speak, he took out his watch: &ldquo;I say! Only twenty-three
      minutes! How time flies! At this rate, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have time to come to an
      explanation.&rdquo; And, stepping still closer to Lupin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to say, I&rsquo;m
      disappointed. I thought that Lupin was a different sort of gentleman. So,
      the moment he meets a more or less serious adversary, the colossus falls
      to pieces? Poor young man! Have a glass of water, to bring you round!&rdquo;
       Lupin did not utter a word, did not betray a gesture of irritation. With
      absolute composure, with a precision of movement that showed his perfect
      self-control and the clear plan of conduct which he had adopted, he gently
      pushed Daubrecq aside, went to the table and, in his turn, took down the
      receiver of the telephone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want 565.34, please,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited until he was through; and then, speaking in a slow voice and
      picking out every syllable, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!... Rue Chateaubriand?... Is that you, Achille?... Yes, it&rsquo;s the
      governor. Listen to me carefully, Achille... You must leave the flat!
      Hullo!... Yes, at once. The police are coming in a few minutes. No, no,
      don&rsquo;t lose your head... You&rsquo;ve got time. Only, do what I tell you. Is your
      bag still packed?... Good. And is one of the sides empty, as I told
      you?... Good. Well, go to my bedroom and stand with your face to the
      chimney-piece. Press with your left hand on the little carved rosette in
      front of the marble slab, in the middle, and with your right hand on the
      top of the mantel-shelf. You&rsquo;ll see a sort of drawer, with two little
      boxes in it. Be careful. One of them contains all our papers; the other,
      bank-notes and jewellery. Put them both in the empty compartment of the
      bag. Take the bag in your hand and go as fast as you can, on foot, to the
      corner of the Avenue Victor-Hugo and the Avenue de Montespan. You&rsquo;ll find
      the car waiting, with Victoire. I&rsquo;ll join you there... What?... My
      clothes? My knickknacks?... Never mind about all that... You be off. See
      you presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin quietly pushed away the telephone. Then, taking Daubrecq by the arm,
      he made him sit in a chair by his side and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now listen to me, Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; grinned the deputy. &ldquo;Calling each other by our surnames, are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;I allowed you to.&rdquo; And, when Daubrecq released his arm
      with a certain misgiving, he said, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be afraid. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come
      to blows. Neither of us has anything to gain by doing away with the other.
      A stab with a knife? What&rsquo;s the good? No, sir! Words, nothing but words.
      Words that strike home, though. Here are mine: they are plain and to the
      point. Answer me in the same way, without reflecting: that&rsquo;s far better.
      The boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. Mergy will kill herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you she will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s tried to, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the reason why she won&rsquo;t try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, after a moment, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected that. Also, I thought, on my way here, that you would hardly
      tumble to the story of Dr. Vernes and that I should have to use other
      methods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lupin&rsquo;s methods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you say. I had made up my mind to throw off the mask. You pulled it
      off for me. Well done you! But that doesn&rsquo;t change my plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin took from a pocketbook a double sheet of foolscap paper, unfolded it
      and handed it to Daubrecq, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is an exact, detailed inventory, with consecutive numbers, of the
      things removed by my friends and myself from your Villa Marie-Therese on
      the Lac d&rsquo;Enghien. As you see, there are one hundred and thirteen items.
      Of those one hundred and thirteen items, sixty-eight, which have a red
      cross against them, have been sold and sent to America. The remainder,
      numbering forty-five, are in my possession... until further orders. They
      happen to be the pick of the bunch. I offer you them in return for the
      immediate surrender of the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq could not suppress a movement of surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You seem very much bent upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infinitely,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;for I am persuaded that a longer separation
      from her son will mean death to Mme. Mergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that upsets you, does it... Lothario?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin planted himself in front of the other and repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing... Nothing... Something that crossed my mind... Clarisse Mergy is
      a young woman still and a pretty woman at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin shrugged his shoulders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brute!&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;You imagine that everybody is like yourself,
      heartless and pitiless. It takes your breath away, what, to think that a
      shark like me can waste his time playing the Don Quixote? And you wonder
      what dirty motive I can have? Don&rsquo;t try to find out: it&rsquo;s beyond your
      powers of perception. Answer me, instead: do you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re serious?&rdquo; asked Daubrecq, who seemed but little disturbed by
      Lupin&rsquo;s contemptuous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. The forty-five pieces are in a shed, of which I will give you
      the address, and they will be handed over to you, if you call there, at
      nine o&rsquo;clock this evening, with the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about Daubrecq&rsquo;s reply. To him, the kidnapping of
      little Jacques had represented only a means of working upon Clarisse
      Mergy&rsquo;s feelings and perhaps also a warning for her to cease the contest
      upon which she had engaged. But the threat of a suicide must needs show
      Daubrecq that he was on the wrong track. That being so, why refuse the
      favourable bargain which Arsene Lupin was now offering him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the address of my shed: 99, Rue Charles-Lafitte, Neuilly. You have
      only to ring the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I send Prasville, the secretary-general, instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you send Prasville,&rdquo; Lupin declared, &ldquo;the place is so arranged that I
      shall see him coming and that I shall have time to escape, after setting
      fire to the trusses of hay and straw which surround and conceal your
      credence-tables, clocks and Gothic virgins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your shed will be burnt down...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that: the police have their eye on it already. I am leaving
      it in any case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how am I to know that this is not a trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin by receiving the goods and don&rsquo;t give up the child till afterward.
      I trust you, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Daubrecq; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve foreseen everything. Very well, you shall
      have the nipper; the fair Clarisse shall live; and we will all be happy.
      And now, if I may give you a word of advice, it is to pack off as fast as
      you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re mad! Prasville&rsquo;s on his way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can wait. I&rsquo;ve not done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what more do you want? Clarisse shall have her brat. Isn&rsquo;t that
      enough for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to save Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying? I save Gilbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can, if you like; it only means taking a little trouble.&rdquo; Until that
      moment Daubrecq had remained quite calm. He now suddenly blazed out and,
      striking the table with his fist:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;not that! Never! Don&rsquo;t reckon on me!... No, that would be
      too idiotic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down, in a state of intense excitement, with that queer
      step of his, which swayed him from right to left on each of his legs, like
      a wild beast, a heavy, clumsy bear. And, with a hoarse voice and distorted
      features, he shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her come here! Let her come and beg for her son&rsquo;s pardon! But let her
      come unarmed, not with criminal intentions, like last time! Let her come
      as a supplicant, as a tamed woman, as a submissive woman, who understands
      and accepts the situation... Gilbert? Gilbert&rsquo;s sentence? The scaffold?
      Why, that is where my strength lies! What! For more than twenty years have
      I awaited my hour; and, when that hour strikes, when fortune brings me
      this unhoped-for chance, when I am at last about to know the joy of a full
      revenge&mdash;and such a revenge!&mdash;you think that I will give it up,
      give up the thing which I have been pursuing for twenty years? I save
      Gilbert? I? For nothing? For love? I, Daubrecq?... No, no, you can&rsquo;t have
      studied my features!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, with a fierce and hateful laugh. Visibly, he saw before him,
      within reach of his hand, the prey which he had been hunting down so long.
      And Lupin also summoned up the vision of Clarisse, as he had seen her
      several days before, fainting, already beaten, fatally conquered, because
      all the hostile powers were in league against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He contained himself and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when Daubrecq moved away impatiently, he took him by the two
      shoulders, with that superhuman strength which Daubrecq knew, from having
      felt it in the box at the Vaudeville, and, holding him motionless in his
      grip, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your breath,&rdquo; growled the deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last word. Listen, Daubrecq: forget Mme. Mergy, give up all the
      nonsensical and imprudent acts which your pride and your passions are
      making you commit; put all that on one side and think only of your
      interest...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My interest,&rdquo; said Daubrecq, jestingly, &ldquo;always coincides with my pride
      and with what you call my passions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to the present, perhaps. But not now, not now that I have taken a hand
      in the business. That constitutes a new factor, which you choose to
      ignore. You are wrong. Gilbert is my pal. Gilbert is my chum. Gilbert has
      to be saved from the scaffold. Use your influence to that end, and I swear
      to you, do you hear, I swear that we will leave you in peace. Gilbert&rsquo;s
      safety, that&rsquo;s all I ask. You will have no more battles to wage with Mme.
      Mergy, with me; there will be no more traps laid for you. You will be the
      master, free to act as you please. Gilbert&rsquo;s safety, Daubrecq! If you
      refuse...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you refuse, it will be war, relentless war; in other words, a certain
      defeat for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning thereby...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning thereby that I shall take the list of the Twenty-seven from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot! You think so, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Prasville and all his men, what Clarisse Mergy, what nobody has been
      able to do, you think that you will do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why? By favour of what saint will you succeed where everybody else
      has failed? There must be a reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Arsene Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had let go of Daubrecq, but held him for a time under the dominion of
      his authoritative glance and will. At last, Daubrecq drew himself up, gave
      him a couple of sharp taps on the shoulder and, with the same calm, the
      same intense obstinacy, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my name&rsquo;s Daubrecq. My whole life has been one desperate battle, one
      long series of catastrophes and routs in which I spent all my energies
      until victory came: complete, decisive, crushing, irrevocable victory. I
      have against me the police, the government, France, the world. What
      difference do you expect it to make to me if I have M. Arsene Lupin
      against me into the bargain? I will go further: the more numerous and
      skilful my enemies, the more cautiously I am obliged to play. And that is
      why, my dear sir, instead of having you arrested, as I might have done&mdash;yes,
      as I might have done and very easily&mdash;I let you remain at large and
      beg charitably to remind you that you must quit in less than three
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the answer is no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer is no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do anything for Gilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall continue to do what I have been doing since his arrest&mdash;that
      is to say, to exercise indirect influence with the minister of justice, so
      that the trial may be hurried on and end in the way in which I want to see
      it end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Lupin, beside himself with indignation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of
      you, it&rsquo;s for you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s for me, Daubrecq; yes, by Jove! I have a trump card, the son&rsquo;s
      head, and I am playing it. When I have procured a nice little
      death-sentence for Gilbert, when the days go by and Gilbert&rsquo;s petition for
      a reprieve is rejected by my good offices, you shall see, M. Lupin, that
      his mummy will drop all her objections to calling herself Mme. Alexis
      Daubrecq and giving me an unexceptionable pledge of her good-will. That
      fortunate issue is inevitable, whether you like it or not. It is
      foredoomed. All I can do for you is to invite you to the wedding and the
      breakfast. Does that suit you? No? You persist in your sinister designs?
      Well, good luck, lay your traps, spread your nets, rub up your weapons and
      grind away at the Complete Foreign-post-paper Burglar&rsquo;s Handbook. You&rsquo;ll
      need it. And now, good-night. The rules of open-handed and disinterested
      hospitality demand that I should turn you out of doors. Hop it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin remained silent for some time. With his eyes fixed on Daubrecq, he
      seemed to be taking his adversary&rsquo;s size, gauging his weight, estimating
      his physical strength, discussing, in fine, in which exact part to attack
      him. Daubrecq clenched his fists and worked out his plan of defence to
      meet the attack when it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a minute passed. Lupin put his hand to his hip-pocket. Daubrecq did
      the same and grasped the handle of his revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds more. Coolly, Lupin produced a little gold box of the kind
      that ladies use for holding sweets, opened it and handed it to Daubrecq:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lozenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the other, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cough-drops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the draught you&rsquo;re going to feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, taking advantage of the momentary fluster into which Daubrecq was
      thrown by his sally, he quickly took his hat and slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, as he crossed the hall, &ldquo;I am knocked into fits. But
      all the same, that bit of commercial-traveller&rsquo;s waggery was rather novel,
      in the circumstances. To expect a pill and receive a cough-drop is by way
      of being a sort of disappointment. It left the old chimpanzee quite
      flummoxed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he closed the gate, a motor-car drove up and a man sprang out briskly,
      followed by several others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin recognized Prasville:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le secretaire-general,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;your humble servant. I
      have an idea that, some day, fate will bring us face to face: and I am
      sorry, for your sake; for you do not inspire me with any particular esteem
      and you have a bad time before you, on that day. Meanwhile, if I were not
      in such a hurry, I should wait till you leave and I should follow Daubrecq
      to find out in whose charge he has placed the child whom he is going to
      hand back to me. But I am in a hurry. Besides, I can&rsquo;t tell that Daubrecq
      won&rsquo;t act by telephone. So let us not waste ourselves in vain efforts, but
      rather join Victoire, Achille and our precious bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, Lupin, after taking all his measures, was on the lookout
      in his shed at Neuilly and saw Daubrecq turn out of an adjoining street
      and walk along with a distrustful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin himself opened the double doors:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your things are in here, monsieur le depute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can go round
      and look. There is a job-master&rsquo;s yard next door: you have only to ask for
      a van and a few men. Where is the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq first inspected the articles and then took Lupin to the Avenue de
      Neuilly, where two closely veiled old ladies stood waiting with little
      Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin carried the child to his car, where Victoire was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was done swiftly, without useless words and as though the parts
      had been got by heart and the various movements settled in advance, like
      so many stage entrances and exits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening Lupin kept his promise and handed little
      Jacques to his mother. But the doctor had to be hurriedly called in, for
      the child, upset by all those happenings, showed great signs of excitement
      and terror. It was more than a fortnight before he was sufficiently
      recovered to bear the strain of the removal which Lupin considered
      necessary. Mme. Mergy herself was only just fit to travel when the time
      came. The journey took place at night, with every possible precaution and
      under Lupin&rsquo;s escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the mother and son to a little seaside place in Brittany and
      entrusted them to Victoire&rsquo;s care and vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he reflected, when he had seen them settled, &ldquo;there is no one
      between the Daubrecq bird and me. He can do nothing more to Mme. Mergy and
      the kid; and she no longer runs the risk of diverting the struggle through
      her intervention. By Jingo, we have made blunders enough! First, I have
      had to disclose myself to Daubrecq. Secondly, I have had to surrender my
      share of the Enghien movables. True, I shall get those back, sooner or
      later; of that there is not the least doubt. But, all the same, we are not
      getting on; and, in a week from now, Gilbert and Vaucheray will be up for
      trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Lupin felt most in the whole business was Daubrecq&rsquo;s revelation of
      the whereabouts of the flat. The police had entered his place in the Rue
      Chateaubriand. The identity of Lupin and Michel Beaumont had been
      recognized and certain papers discovered; and Lupin, while pursuing his
      aim, while, at the same time, managing various enterprises on which he had
      embarked, while avoiding the searches of the police, which were becoming
      more zealous and persistent than ever, had to set to work and reorganize
      his affairs throughout on a fresh basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rage with Daubrecq, therefore, increased in proportion to the worry
      which the deputy caused him. He had but one longing, to pocket him, as he
      put it, to have him at his bidding by fair means or foul, to extract his
      secret from him. He dreamt of tortures fit to unloose the tongue of the
      most silent of men. The boot, the rack, red-hot pincers, nailed planks: no
      form of suffering, he thought, was more than the enemy deserved; and the
      end to be attained justified every means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;oh, for a decent bench of inquisitors and a
      couple of bold executioners!... What a time we should have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every afternoon the Growler and the Masher watched the road which Daubrecq
      took between the Square Lamartine, the Chamber of Deputies and his club.
      Their instructions were to choose the most deserted street and the most
      favourable moment and, one evening, to hustle him into a motor-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, on his side, got ready an old building, standing in the middle of a
      large garden, not far from Paris, which presented all the necessary
      conditions of safety and isolation and which he called the Monkey&rsquo;s Cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Daubrecq must have suspected something, for every time, so
      to speak, he changed his route, or took the underground or a tram; and the
      cage remained unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin devised another plan. He sent to Marseilles for one of his
      associates, an elderly retired grocer called Brindebois, who happened to
      live in Daubrecq&rsquo;s electoral district and interested himself in politics.
      Old Brindebois wrote to Daubrecq from Marseilles, announcing his visit.
      Daubrecq gave this important constituent a hearty welcome, and a dinner
      was arranged for the following week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elector suggested a little restaurant on the left bank of the Seine,
      where the food, he said, was something wonderful. Daubrecq accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what Lupin wanted. The proprietor of the restaurant was one of
      his friends. The attempt, which was to take place on the following
      Thursday, was this time bound to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, on the Monday of the same week, the trial of Gilbert and
      Vaucheray opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will remember&mdash;and the case took place too recently for me
      to recapitulate its details&mdash;the really incomprehensible partiality
      which the presiding judge showed in his cross-examination of Gilbert. The
      thing was noticed and severely criticised at the time. Lupin recognized
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s hateful influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude observed by the two prisoners differed greatly. Vaucheray was
      gloomy, silent, hard-faced. He cynically, in curt, sneering, almost
      defiant phrases, admitted the crimes of which he had formerly been guilty.
      But, with an inconsistency which puzzled everybody except Lupin, he denied
      any participation in the murder of Leonard the valet and violently accused
      Gilbert. His object, in thus linking his fate with Gilbert&rsquo;s, was to force
      Lupin to take identical measures for the rescue of both his accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert, on the other hand, whose frank countenance and dreamy, melancholy
      eyes won every sympathy, was unable to protect himself against the traps
      laid for him by the judge or to counteract Vaucheray&rsquo;s lies. He burst into
      tears, talked too much, or else did not talk when he should have talked.
      Moreover, his counsel, one of the Leaders of the bar, was taken ill at the
      last moment&mdash;and here again Lupin saw the hand of Daubrecq&mdash;and
      he was replaced by a junior who spoke badly, muddied the whole case, set
      the jury against him and failed to wipe out the impression produced by the
      speeches of the advocate-general and of Vaucheray&rsquo;s counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, who had the inconceivable audacity to be present on the last day of
      the trial, the Thursday, had no doubt as to the result. A verdict of
      guilty was certain in both cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certain because all the efforts of the prosecution, thus supporting
      Vaucheray&rsquo;s tactics, had tended to link the two prisoners closely
      together. It was certain, also and above all, because it concerned two of
      Lupin&rsquo;s accomplices. From the opening of the inquiry before the magistrate
      until the delivery of the verdict, all the proceedings had been directed
      against Lupin; and this in spite of the fact that the prosecution, for
      want of sufficient evidence and also in order not to scatter its efforts
      over too wide an area, had decided not to include Lupin in the indictment.
      He was the adversary aimed at, the leader who must be punished in the
      person of his friends, the famous and popular scoundrel whose fascination
      in the eyes of the crowd must be destroyed for good and all. With Gilbert
      and Vaucheray executed, Lupin&rsquo;s halo would fade away and the legend would
      be exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin... Lupin... Arsene Lupin: it was the one name heard throughout the
      four days. The advocate-general, the presiding judge, the jury, the
      counsel, the witnesses had no other words on their lips. Every moment,
      Lupin was mentioned and cursed at, scoffed at, insulted and held
      responsible for all the crimes committed. It was as though Gilbert and
      Vaucheray figured only as supernumeraries, while the real criminal
      undergoing trial was he, Lupin, Master Lupin, Lupin the burglar, the
      leader of a gang of thieves, the forger, the incendiary, the hardened
      offender, the ex-convict, Lupin the murderer, Lupin stained with the blood
      of his victim, Lupin lurking in the shade, like a coward, after sending
      his friends to the foot of the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the rascals know what they&rsquo;re about!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my debt
      which they are making my poor old Gilbert pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the terrible tragedy went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, after a long deliberation, the jury
      returned to court and the foreman read out the answers to the questions
      put from the bench. The answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to every count of the indictment,
      a verdict of guilty without extenuating circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners were brought in. Standing up, but staggering and
      white-faced, they received their sentence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, amid the great, solemn silence, in which the anxiety of the onlookers
      was mingled with pity, the assize-president asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything more to say, Vaucheray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, monsieur le president. Now that my mate is sentenced as well as
      myself, I am easy... We are both on the same footing... The governor must
      find a way to save the two of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Arsene Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh among the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Gilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears streamed down the poor lad&rsquo;s cheeks and he stammered a few
      inarticulate sentences. But, when the judge repeated his question, he
      succeeded in mastering himself and replied, in a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to say, monsieur le president, that I am guilty of many things,
      that&rsquo;s true... I have done a lot of harm... But, all the same, not this.
      No, I have not committed murder... I have never committed murder... And I
      don&rsquo;t want to die... it would be too horrible...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed from side to side, supported by the warders, and he was heard to
      cry, like a child calling for help:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor... save me!... Save me!... I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the crowd, amid the general excitement, a voice rose above the
      surrounding clamour:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, little &lsquo;un!... The governor&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tumult and hustling followed. The municipal guards and the policemen
      rushed into court and laid hold of a big, red-faced man, who was stated by
      his neighbours to be the author of that outburst and who struggled hand
      and foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Questioned without delay, he gave his name, Philippe Bonel, an
      undertaker&rsquo;s man, and declared that some one sitting beside him had
      offered him a hundred-franc note if he would consent, at the proper
      moment, to shout a few words which his neighbour scribbled on a bit of
      paper. How could he refuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      In proof of his statements, he produced the hundred-franc note and the
      scrap of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippe Bonel was let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Lupin, who of course had assisted energetically in the
      individual&rsquo;s arrest and handed him over to the guards, left the
      law-courts, his heart heavy with anguish. His car was waiting for him on
      the quay. He flung himself into it, in despair, seized with so great a
      sorrow that he had to make an effort to restrain his tears. Gilbert&rsquo;s cry,
      his voice wrung with affliction, his distorted features, his tottering
      frame: all this haunted his brain; and he felt as if he would never, for a
      single second, forget those impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove home to the new place which he had selected among his different
      residences and which occupied a corner of the Place de Clichy. He expected
      to find the Growler and the Masher, with whom he was to kidnap Daubrecq
      that evening. But he had hardly opened the door of his flat, when a cry
      escaped him: Clarisse stood before him; Clarisse, who had returned from
      Brittany at the moment of the verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once gathered from her attitude and her pallor that she knew. And,
      at once, recovering his courage in her presence, without giving her time
      to speak, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes... but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We foresaw that. We couldn&rsquo;t
      prevent it. What we have to do is to stop the mischief. And to-night, you
      understand, to-night, the thing will be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Motionless and tragic in her sorrow, she stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have prepared everything. In two hours, Daubrecq will be in my
      hands. To-night, whatever means I have to employ, he shall speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo; she asked, faintly, while a ray of hope began to light
      up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall speak. I shall have his secret. I shall tear the list of the
      Twenty-seven from him. And that list will set your son free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Clarisse murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late? Why? Do you think that, in exchange for such a document, I
      shall not obtain Gilbert&rsquo;s pretended escape?... Why, Gilbert will be at
      liberty in three days! In three days...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a ring at the bell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, here are our friends. Trust me. Remember that I keep my promises.
      I gave you back your little Jacques. I shall give you back Gilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to let the Growler and the Masher in and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is everything ready? Is old Brindebois at the restaurant? Quick, let us
      be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, governor,&rdquo; replied the Masher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news? Speak, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq has disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What&rsquo;s that? Daubrecq disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, carried off from his house, in broad daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil! By whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows... four men... there were pistols fired... The police are on
      the spot. Prasville is directing the investigations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not move a limb. He looked at Clarisse Mergy, who lay huddled in
      a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself had to bow his head. Daubrecq carried off meant one more chance
      of success lost...

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE PROFILE OF NAPOLEON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon as the prefect of police, the chief of the criminal-investigation
      department and the examining-magistrates had left Daubrecq&rsquo;s house, after
      a preliminary and entirely fruitless inquiry, Prasville resumed his
      personal search.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was examining the study and the traces of the struggle which had taken
      place there, when the portress brought him a visiting-card, with a few
      words in pencil scribbled upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the lady in,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady has some one with her,&rdquo; said the portress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Well, show the other person in as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse Mergy entered at once and introduced the gentleman with her, a
      gentleman in a black frock-coat, which was too tight for him and which
      looked as though it had not been brushed for ages. He was shy in his
      manner and seemed greatly embarrassed how to dispose of his old, rusty
      top-hat, his gingham umbrella, his one and only glove and his body
      generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Nicole,&rdquo; said Clarisse, &ldquo;a private teacher, who is acting as tutor to
      my little Jacques. M. Nicole has been of the greatest help to me with his
      advice during the past year. He worked out the whole story of the crystal
      stopper. I should like him, as well as myself&mdash;if you see no
      objection to telling me&mdash;to know the details of this kidnapping
      business, which alarms me and upsets my plans; yours too, I expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville had every confidence in Clarisse Mergy. He knew her relentless
      hatred of Daubrecq and appreciated the assistance which she had rendered
      in the case. He therefore made no difficulties about telling her what he
      knew, thanks to certain clues and especially to the evidence of the
      portress.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that matter, the thing was exceedingly simple. Daubrecq, who had
      attended the trial of Gilbert and Vaucheray as a witness and who was seen
      in court during the speeches, returned home at six o&rsquo;clock. The portress
      affirmed that he came in alone and that there was nobody in the house at
      the time. Nevertheless, a few minutes later, she heard shouts, followed by
      the sound of a struggle and two pistol-shots; and from her lodge she saw
      four masked men scuttle down the front steps, carrying Daubrecq the
      deputy, and hurry toward the gate. They opened the gate. At the same
      moment, a motor-car arrived outside the house. The four men bundled
      themselves into it; and the motor-car, which had hardly had time to stop,
      set off at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there not always two policemen on duty?&rdquo; asked Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were there,&rdquo; said Prasville, &ldquo;but at a hundred and fifty yards&rsquo; 
      distance; and Daubrecq was carried off so quickly that they were unable to
      interfere, although they hastened up as fast as they could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did they discover nothing, find nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, or hardly anything... Merely this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little piece of ivory, which they picked up on the ground. There was a
      fifth party in the car; and the portress saw him get down while the others
      were hoisting Daubrecq in. As he was stepping back into the car, he
      dropped something and picked it up again at once. But the thing, whatever
      it was, must have been broken on the pavement; for this is the bit of
      ivory which my men found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did the four men manage to enter the house?&rdquo; asked Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By means of false keys, evidently, while the portress was doing her
      shopping, in the course of the afternoon; and they had no difficulty in
      secreting themselves, as Daubrecq keeps no other servants. I have every
      reason to believe that they hid in the room next door, which is the
      dining-room, and afterward attacked Daubrecq here, in the study. The
      disturbance of the furniture and other articles proves how violent the
      struggle was. We found a large-bore revolver, belonging to Daubrecq, on
      the carpet. One of the bullets had smashed the glass over the
      mantel-piece, as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse turned to her companion for him to express an opinion. But M.
      Nicole, with his eyes obstinately lowered, had not budged from his chair
      and sat fumbling at the rim of his hat, as though he had not yet found a
      proper place for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville gave a smile. It was evident that he did not look upon
      Clarisse&rsquo;s adviser as a man of first-rate intelligence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case is somewhat puzzling, monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... yes,&rdquo; M. Nicole confessed, &ldquo;most puzzling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have no little theory of your own upon the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur le secretaire-general, I&rsquo;m thinking that Daubrecq has many
      enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, capital!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that several of those enemies, who are interested in his
      disappearance, must have banded themselves against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital, capital!&rdquo; said Prasville, with satirical approval. &ldquo;Capital!
      Everything is becoming clear as daylight. It only remains for you to
      furnish us with a little suggestion that will enable us to turn our search
      in the right direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, monsieur le secretaire-general, that this broken bit of
      ivory which was picked up on the ground...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, M. Nicole, no. That bit of ivory belongs to something which we do not
      know and which its owner will at once make it his business to conceal. In
      order to trace the owner, we should at least be able to define the nature
      of the thing itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole reflected and then began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le secretaire-general, when Napoleon I fell from power...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Nicole, oh, a lesson in French history!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a sentence, monsieur le secretaire-general, just one sentence which
      I will ask your leave to complete. When Napoleon I fell from power, the
      Restoration placed a certain number of officers on half-pay. These
      officers were suspected by the authorities and kept under observation by
      the police. They remained faithful to the emperor&rsquo;s memory; and they
      contrived to reproduce the features of their idol on all sorts of objects
      of everyday use; snuff-boxes, rings, breast-pins, pen-knives and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this bit comes from a walking-stick, or rather a sort of loaded
      cane, or life-preserver, the knob of which is formed of a piece of carved
      ivory. When you look at the knob in a certain way, you end by seeing that
      the outline represents the profile of the Little Corporal. What you have
      in your hand, monsieur le secretaire-general, is a bit of the ivory knob
      at the top of a half-pay officer&rsquo;s life-preserver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Prasville, examining the exhibit, &ldquo;yes, I can make out a
      profile... but I don&rsquo;t see the inference...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inference is very simple. Among Daubrecq&rsquo;s victims, among those whose
      names are inscribed on the famous list, is the descendant of a Corsican
      family in Napoleon&rsquo;s service, which derived its wealth and title from the
      emperor and was afterward ruined under the Restoration. It is ten to one
      that this descendant, who was the leader of the Bonapartist party a few
      years ago, was the fifth person hiding in the motor-car. Need I state his
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex?&rdquo; said Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex,&rdquo; said M. Nicole.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole, who no longer seemed in the least worried with his hat, his
      glove and his umbrella, rose and said to Prasville:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le secretaire-general, I might have kept my discovery to myself,
      and not told you of it until after the final victory, that is, after
      bringing you the list of the Twenty-seven. But matters are urgent.
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s disappearance, contrary to what his kidnappers expect, may
      hasten on the catastrophe which you wish to avert. We must therefore act
      with all speed. Monsieur le secretaire-general, I ask for your immediate
      and practical assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way can I help you?&rdquo; asked Prasville, who was beginning to be
      impressed by his quaint visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By giving me, to-morrow, those particulars about the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex
      which it would take me personally several days to collect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville seemed to hesitate and turned his head toward Mme. Mergy.
      Clarisse said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you to accept M. Nicole&rsquo;s services. He is an invaluable and
      devoted ally. I will answer for him as I would for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What particulars do you require, monsieur?&rdquo; asked Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything that concerns the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex: the position of his
      family, the way in which he spends his time, his family connections, the
      properties which he owns in Paris and in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville objected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, whether it&rsquo;s the marquis or another, Daubrecq&rsquo;s kidnapper is
      working on our behalf, seeing that, by capturing the list, he disarms
      Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who says, monsieur le secretaire-general, that he is not working on
      his own behalf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not possible, as his name is on the list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose he erases it? Suppose you then find yourself dealing with a
      second blackmailer, even more grasping and more powerful than the first
      and one who, as a political adversary, is in a better position than
      Daubrecq to maintain the contest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary-general was struck by the argument. After a moment&rsquo;s
      thought, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see me in my office at four o&rsquo;clock tomorrow. I will give you
      the particulars. What is your address, in case I should want you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Nicole, 25, Place de Clichy. I am staying at a friend&rsquo;s flat, which he
      has lent me during his absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interview was at an end. M. Nicole thanked the secretary-general, with
      a very low bow, and walked out, accompanied by Mme. Mergy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an excellent piece of work,&rdquo; he said, outside, rubbing his hands.
      &ldquo;I can march into the police-office whenever I like, and set the whole lot
      to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Mergy, who was less hopefully inclined, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, will you be in time? What terrifies me is the thought that the list
      may be destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious me, by whom? By Daubrecq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but by the marquis, when he gets hold of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got it yet! Daubrecq will resist long enough, at any rate, for
      us to reach him. Just think! Prasville is at my orders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he discovers who you are? The least inquiry will prove that there
      is no such person as M. Nicole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will not prove that M. Nicole is the same person as Arsene Lupin.
      Besides, make yourself easy. Prasville is not only beneath contempt as a
      detective: he has but one aim in life, which is to destroy his old enemy,
      Daubrecq. To achieve that aim, all means are equally good; and he will not
      waste time in verifying the identity of a M. Nicole who promises him
      Daubrecq. Not to mention that I was brought by you and that, when all is
      said, my little gifts did dazzle him to some extent. So let us go ahead
      boldly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse always recovered confidence in Lupin&rsquo;s presence. The future
      seemed less appalling to her; and she admitted, she forced herself to
      admit, that the chances of saving Gilbert were not lessened by that
      hideous death-sentence. But he could not prevail upon her to return to
      Brittany. She wanted to fight by his side. She wanted to be there and
      share all his hopes and all his disappointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the inquiries of the police confirmed what Prasville and
      Lupin already knew. The Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex had been very deeply involved in
      the business of the canal, so deeply that Prince Napoleon was obliged to
      remove him from the management of his political campaign in France; and he
      kept up his very extravagant style of living only by dint of constant
      loans and makeshifts. On the other hand, in so far as concerned the
      kidnapping of Daubrecq, it was ascertained that, contrary to his usual
      custom, the marquis had not appeared in his club between six and seven
      that evening and had not dined at home. He did not come back until
      midnight; and then he came on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole&rsquo;s accusation, therefore, was receiving an early proof.
      Unfortunately&mdash;and Lupin was no more successful in his own attempts&mdash;it
      was impossible to obtain the least clue as to the motor-car, the chauffeur
      and the four people who had entered Daubrecq&rsquo;s house. Were they associates
      of the marquis, compromised in the canal affair like himself? Were they
      men in his pay? Nobody knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole search, consequently, had to be concentrated upon the marquis
      and the country-seats and houses which he might possess at a certain
      distance from Paris, a distance which, allowing for the average speed of a
      motor-car and the inevitable stoppages, could be put at sixty to ninety
      miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now d&rsquo;Albufex, having sold everything that he ever had, possessed neither
      country-houses nor landed estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned their attention to the marquis&rsquo; relations and intimate
      friends. Was he able on this side to dispose of some safe retreat in which
      to imprison Daubrecq?
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was equally fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the days passed. And what days for Clarisse Mergy! Each of them
      brought Gilbert nearer to the terrible day of reckoning. Each of them
      meant twenty-four hours less from the date which Clarisse had
      instinctively fixed in her mind. And she said to Lupin, who was racked
      with the same anxiety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty-five days more... Fifty days more... What can one do in so few
      days?... Oh, I beg of you... I beg of you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could they do indeed? Lupin, who would not leave the task of watching
      the marquis to any one but himself, practically lived without sleeping.
      But the marquis had resumed his regular life; and, doubtless suspecting
      something, did not risk going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once alone, he went down to the Duc de Montmaur&rsquo;s, in the daytime. The
      duke kept a pack of boar-hounds, with which he hunted the Forest of
      Durlaine. D&rsquo;Albufex maintained no relations with him outside the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly likely,&rdquo; said Prasville, &ldquo;that the Duc de Montmaur, an
      exceedingly wealthy man, who is interested only in his estates and his
      hunting and takes no part in politics, should lend himself to the illegal
      detention of Daubrecq the deputy in his chateau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin agreed; but, as he did not wish to leave anything to chance, the
      next week, seeing d&rsquo;Albufex go out one morning in riding-dress, he
      followed him to the Gare du Nord and took the same train.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out at Aumale, where d&rsquo;Albufex found a carriage at the station
      which took him to the Chateau de Montmaur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin lunched quietly, hired a bicycle and came in view of the house at
      the moment when the guests were going into the park, in motor-cars or
      mounted. The Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex was one of the horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrice, in the course of the day, Lupin saw him cantering along. And he
      found him, in the evening, at the station, where d&rsquo;Albufex rode up,
      followed by a huntsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof, therefore, was conclusive; and there was nothing suspicious on
      that side. Why did Lupin, nevertheless, resolve not to be satisfied with
      appearances? And why, next day, did he send the Masher to find out things
      in the neighbourhood of Montmaur? It was an additional precaution, based
      upon no logical reason, but agreeing with his methodical and careful
      manner of acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he received from the Masher, among other information of
      less importance, a list of the house-party at Montmaur and of all the
      servants and keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One name struck him, among those of the huntsmen. He at once wired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inquire about huntsman Sebastiani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Masher&rsquo;s answer was received the next day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sebastiani, a Corsican, was recommended to the Duc de Montmaur by the
      Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex. He lives at two or three miles from the house, in a
      hunting-lodge built among the ruins of the feudal stronghold which was the
      cradle of the Montmaur family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Lupin to Clarisse Mergy, showing her the Masher&rsquo;s
      letter. &ldquo;That name, Sebastiani, at once reminded me that d&rsquo;Albufex is of
      Corsican descent. There was a connection...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you intend to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Daubrecq is imprisoned in those ruins, I intend to enter into
      communication with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will distrust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Lately, acting on the information of the police, I ended by
      discovering the two old ladies who carried off your little Jacques at
      Saint-Germain and who brought him, the same evening, to Neuilly. They are
      two old maids, cousins of Daubrecq, who makes them a small monthly
      allowance. I have been to call on those Demoiselles Rousselot; remember
      the name and the address: 134 bis, Rue du Bac. I inspired them with
      confidence, promised them to find their cousin and benefactor; and the
      elder sister, Euphrasie Rousselot, gave me a letter in which she begs
      Daubrecq to trust M. Nicole entirely. So you see, I have taken every
      precaution. I shall leave to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, you mean,&rdquo; said Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I go on living like this, in feverish inaction?&rdquo; And she whispered,
      &ldquo;I am no longer counting the days, the thirty-eight or forty days that
      remain to us: I am counting the hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin felt that her resolution was too strong for him to try to combat it.
      They both started at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, by motor-car. The
      Growler went with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as not to arouse suspicion, Lupin chose a large town as his
      headquarters. At Amiens, where he installed Clarisse, he was only eighteen
      miles from Montmaur.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock he met the Masher not far from the old fortress, which
      was known in the neighbourhood by the name of Mortepierre, and he examined
      the locality under his guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the confines of the forest, the little river Ligier, which has dug
      itself a deep valley at this spot, forms a loop which is overhung by the
      enormous cliff of Mortepierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to be done on this side,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;The cliff is steep, over
      two hundred feet high, and the river hugs it all round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not far away they found a bridge that led to the foot of a path which
      wound, through the oaks and pines, up to a little esplanade, where stood a
      massive, iron-bound gate, studded with nails and flanked on either side by
      a large tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this where Sebastiani the huntsman lives?&rdquo; asked Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Masher, &ldquo;with his wife, in a lodge standing in the midst
      of the ruins. I also learnt that he has three tall sons and that all the
      four were supposed to be away for a holiday on the day when Daubrecq was
      carried off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;The coincidence is worth remembering. It seems likely
      enough that the business was done by those chaps and their father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end of the afternoon Lupin availed himself of a breach to the
      right of the towers to scale the curtain. From there he was able to see
      the huntsman&rsquo;s lodge and the few remains of the old fortress: here, a bit
      of wall, suggesting the mantel of a chimney; further away, a water-tank;
      on this side, the arches of a chapel; on the other, a heap of fallen
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      A patrol-path edged the cliff in front; and, at one of the ends of this
      patrol-path, there were the remains of a formidable donjon-keep razed
      almost level with the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin returned to Clarisse Mergy in the evening. And from that time he
      went backward and forward between Amiens and Mortepierre, leaving the
      Growler and the Masher permanently on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      And six days passed. Sebastiani&rsquo;s habits seemed to be subject solely to
      the duties of his post. He used to go up to the Chateau de Montmaur, walk
      about in the forest, note the tracks of the game and go his rounds at
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the seventh day, learning that there was to be a meet and that a
      carriage had been sent to Aumale Station in the morning, Lupin took up his
      post in a cluster of box and laurels which surrounded the little esplanade
      in front of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock he heard the pack give tongue. They approached, accompanied
      by hunting-cries, and then drew farther away. He heard them again, about
      the middle of the afternoon, not quite so distinctly; and that was all.
      But suddenly, amid the silence, the sound of galloping horses reached his
      ears; and, a few minutes later, he saw two riders climbing the river-path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recognized the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex and Sebastiani. On reaching the
      esplanade, they both alighted; and a woman&mdash;the huntsman&rsquo;s wife, no
      doubt&mdash;opened the gate. Sebastiani fastened the horses&rsquo; bridles to
      rings fixed on a post at a few yards from Lupin and ran to join the
      marquis. The gate closed behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not hesitate; and, though it was still broad daylight, relying
      upon the solitude of the place, he hoisted himself to the hollow of the
      breach. Passing his head through cautiously, he saw the two men and
      Sebastiani&rsquo;s wife hurrying toward the ruins of the keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huntsman drew aside a hanging screen of ivy and revealed the entrance
      to a stairway, which he went down, as did d&rsquo;Albufex, leaving his wife on
      guard on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no question of going in after them; and Lupin returned to his
      hiding-place. He did not wait long before the gate opened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex seemed in a great rage. He was striking the leg of
      his boot with his whip and mumbling angry words which Lupin was able to
      distinguish when the distance became less great:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the hound!... I&rsquo;ll make him speak... I&rsquo;ll come back to-night...
      to-night, at ten o&rsquo;clock, do you hear, Sebastiani?... And we shall do
      what&rsquo;s necessary... Oh, the brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani unfastened the horses. D&rsquo;Albufex turned to the woman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that your sons keep a good watch... If any one attempts to deliver
      him, so much the worse for him. The trapdoor is there. Can I rely upon
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As thoroughly as on myself, monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; declared the huntsman.
      &ldquo;They know what monsieur le marquis has done for me and what he means to
      do for them. They will shrink at nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us mount and get back to the hounds,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Albufex.
    </p>
    <p>
      So things were going as Lupin had supposed. During these runs, d&rsquo;Albufex,
      taking a line of his own, would push off to Mortepierre, without anybody&rsquo;s
      suspecting his trick. Sebastiani, who was devoted to him body and soul,
      for reasons connected with the past into which it was not worth while to
      inquire, accompanied him; and together they went to see the captive, who
      was closely watched by the huntsman&rsquo;s wife and his three sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we stand,&rdquo; said Lupin to Clarisse Mergy, when he joined her
      at a neighbouring inn. &ldquo;This evening the marquis will put Daubrecq to the
      question&mdash;a little brutally, but indispensably&mdash;as I intended to
      do myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Daubrecq will give up his secret,&rdquo; said Clarisse, already quite
      upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hesitating between two plans,&rdquo; said Lupin, who seemed very calm.
      &ldquo;Either to prevent the interview...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By forestalling d&rsquo;Albufex. At nine o&rsquo;clock, the Growler, the Masher and I
      climb the ramparts, burst into the fortress, attack the keep, disarm the
      garrison... and the thing&rsquo;s done: Daubrecq is ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless Sebastiani&rsquo;s sons fling him through the trapdoor to which the
      marquis alluded...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that reason,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;I intend to risk that violent measure only
      as a last resort and in case my other plan should not be practicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the other plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To witness the interview. If Daubrecq does not speak, it will give us the
      time to prepare to carry him off under more favourable conditions. If he
      speaks, if they compel him to reveal the place where the list of the
      Twenty-seven is hidden, I shall know the truth at the same time as
      d&rsquo;Albufex, and I swear to God that I shall turn it to account before he
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Clarisse. &ldquo;But how do you propose to be present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Lupin confessed. &ldquo;It depends on certain particulars
      which the Masher is to bring me and on some which I shall find out for
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the inn and did not return until an hour later as night was
      falling. The Masher joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the little book?&rdquo; asked Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, governor. It was what I saw at the Aumale newspaper-shop. I got it
      for ten sous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Masher handed him an old, soiled, torn pamphlet, entitled, on the
      cover, A Visit to Mortepierre, 1824, with plans and illustrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin at once looked for the plan of the donjon-keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Above the ground were three stories, which have
      been razed, and below the ground, dug out of the rock, two stories, one of
      which was blocked up by the rubbish, while the other... There, that&rsquo;s
      where our friend Daubrecq lies. The name is significant: the
      torture-chamber... Poor, dear friend!... Between the staircase and the
      torture-chamber, two doors. Between those two doors, a recess in which the
      three brothers obviously sit, gun in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is impossible for you to get in that way without being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible... unless I come from above, by the story that has fallen in,
      and look for a means of entrance through the ceiling... But that is very
      risky...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to turn the pages of the book. Clarisse asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no window to the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From below, from the river&mdash;I have just been there&mdash;you
      can see a little opening, which is also marked on the plan. But it is
      fifty yards up, sheer; and even then the rock overhangs the water. So that
      again is out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced through a few pages of the book. The title of one chapter
      struck him: The Lovers&rsquo; Towers. He read the opening lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;In the old days, the donjon was known to the people of the
 neighbourhood as the Lovers&rsquo; Tower, in memory of a fatal tragedy
 that marked it in the Middle Ages.  The Comte de Mortepierre,
 having received proofs of his wife&rsquo;s faithlessness, imprisoned
 her in the torture-chamber, where she spent twenty years.  One
 night, her lover, the Sire de Tancarville, with reckless courage,
 set up a ladder in the river and then clambered up the face of
 the cliff till he came to the window of the room.  After filing
 the bars, he succeeded in releasing the woman he loved and
 bringing her down with him by means of a rope.  They both reached
 the top of the ladder, which was watched by his friends, when a
 shot was fired from the patrol-path and hit the man in the
 shoulder.  The two lovers were hurled into space....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was a pause, after he had read this, a long pause during which each
      of them drew a mental picture of the tragic escape. So, three or four
      centuries earlier, a man, risking his life, had attempted that surprising
      feat and would have succeeded but for the vigilance of some sentry who
      heard the noise. A man had ventured! A man had dared! A man done it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin raised his eyes to Clarisse. She was looking at him... with such a
      desperate, such a beseeching look! The look of a mother who demanded the
      impossible and who would have sacrificed anything to save her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get a strong rope, but very slender, so that I can
      roll it round my waist, and very long: fifty or sixty yards. You, Growler,
      go and look for three or four ladders and fasten them end to end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what are you thinking of, governor?&rdquo; cried the two accomplices.
      &ldquo;What, you mean to... But it&rsquo;s madness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madness? Why? What another has done I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a hundred chances to one that you break your neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, Masher, there&rsquo;s one chance that I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, governor...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, my friends. Meet me in an hour on the river-bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The preparations took long in the making. It was difficult to find the
      material for a fifty-foot ladder that would reach the first ledge of the
      cliff; and it required an endless effort and care to join the different
      sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, a little after nine o&rsquo;clock, it was set up in the middle of the
      river and held in position by a boat, the bows of which were wedged
      between two of the rungs, while the stern was rammed into the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road through the river-valley was little used, and nobody came to
      interrupt the work. The night was dark, the sky heavy with moveless
      clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin gave the Masher and the Growler their final instructions and said,
      with a laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how amused I am at the thought of seeing Daubrecq&rsquo;s face
      when they proceed to take his scalp or slice his skin into ribbons. Upon
      my word, it&rsquo;s worth the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse also had taken a seat in the boat. He said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until we meet again. And, above all, don&rsquo;t stir. Whatever happens, not a
      movement, not a cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can anything happen?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, remember the Sire de Tancarville! It was at the very moment when he
      was achieving his object, with his true love in his arms, that an accident
      betrayed him. But be easy: I shall be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply. She seized his hand and grasped it warmly between her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his foot on the ladder and made sure that it did not sway too much.
      Then he went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon reached the top rung.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was where the dangerous ascent began, a difficult ascent at the
      start, because of the excessive steepness, and developing, mid-way, into
      an absolute escalade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, here and there were little hollows, in which his feet found a
      resting-place, and projecting stones, to which his hands clung. But twice
      those stones gave way and he slipped; and twice he firmly believed that
      all was lost. Finding a deeper hollow, he took a rest. He was worn out,
      felt quite ready to throw up the enterprise, asked himself if it was
      really worth while for him to expose himself to such danger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;re showing the white feather, Lupin,
      old boy. Throw up the enterprise? Then Daubrecq will babble his secret,
      the marquis will possess himself of the list, Lupin will return
      empty-handed, and Gilbert...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The long rope which he had fastened round his waist caused him needless
      inconvenience and fatigue. He fixed one of the ends to the strap of his
      trousers and let the rope uncoil all the way down the ascent, so that he
      could use it, on returning, as a hand-rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he once more clutched at the rough surface of the cliff and continued
      the climb, with bruised nails and bleeding fingers. At every moment he
      expected the inevitable fall. And what discouraged him most was to hear
      the murmur of voices rising from the boat, murmur so distinct that it
      seemed as though he were not increasing the distance between his
      companions and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he remembered the Sire de Tancarville, alone, he too, amid the
      darkness, who must have shivered at the noise of the stones which he
      loosened and sent bounding down the cliff. How the least sound
      reverberated through the silence! If one of Daubrecq&rsquo;s guards was peering
      into the gloom from the Lovers&rsquo; Tower, it meant a shot... and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he climbed... he climbed... He had climbed so long that he ended by
      imagining that the goal was passed. Beyond a doubt, he had slanted
      unawares to the right or left and he would finish at the patrol-path. What
      a stupid upshot! And what other upshot could there be to an attempt which
      the swift force of events had not allowed him to study and prepare?
    </p>
    <p>
      Madly, he redoubled his efforts, raised himself by a number of yards,
      slipped, recovered the lost ground, clutched a bunch of roots that came
      loose in his hand, slipped once more and was abandoning the game in
      despair when, suddenly, stiffening himself and contracting his whole
      frame, his muscles and his will, he stopped still: a sound of voices
      seemed to issue from the very rock which he was grasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened. It came from the right. Turning his head, he thought that he
      saw a ray of light penetrating the darkness of space. By what effort of
      energy, by what imperceptible movements he succeeded in dragging himself
      to the spot he was never able exactly to realize. But suddenly he found
      himself on the ledge of a fairly wide opening, at least three yards deep,
      which dug into the wall of the cliff like a passage, while its other end,
      much narrower, was closed by three bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin crawled along. His head reached the bars. And he saw...

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE LOVERS&rsquo; TOWER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The torture-chamber showed beneath him. It was a large, irregular room,
      divided into unequal portions by the four wide, massive pillars that
      supported its arched roof. A smell of damp and mildew came from its walls
      and from its flags moistened by the water that trickled from without. Its
      appearance at any time must have been gruesome. But, at that moment, with
      the tall figures of Sebastiani and his sons, with the slanting gleams of
      light that fell between the pillars, with the vision of the captive
      chained down upon the truckle-bed, it assumed a sinister and barbarous
      aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq was in the front part of the room, four or five yards down from
      the window at which Lupin lurked. In addition to the ancient chains that
      had been used to fasten him to his bed and to fasten the bed to an iron
      hook in the wall, his wrists and ankles were girt with leather thongs; and
      an ingenious arrangement caused his least movement to set in motion a bell
      hung to the nearest pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lamp placed on a stool lit him full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex was standing beside him. Lupin could see his pale
      features, his grizzled moustache, his long, lean form as he looked at his
      prisoner with an expression of content and of gratified hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes passed in profound silence. Then the marquis gave an order:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light those three candles, Sebastiani, so that I can see him better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when the three candles were lit and he had taken a long look at
      Daubrecq, he stooped over him and said, almost gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what will be the end of you and me. But at any rate I shall
      have had some deuced happy moments in this room. You have done me so much
      harm, Daubrecq! The tears you have made me shed! Yes, real tears, real
      sobs of despair... The money you have robbed me of! A fortune!... And my
      terror at the thought that you might give me away! You had but to utter my
      name to complete my ruin and bring about my disgrace!... Oh, you
      villain!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq did not budge. He had been deprived of his black glasses, but
      still kept his spectacles, which reflected the light from the candles. He
      had lost a good deal of flesh; and the bones stood out above his sunken
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Albufex. &ldquo;The time has come to act. It seems that
      there are rogues prowling about the neighbourhood. Heaven forbid that they
      are here on your account and try to release you; for that would mean your
      immediate death, as you know... Is the trapdoor still in working order,
      Sebastiani?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani came nearer, knelt on one knee and lifted and turned a ring, at
      the foot of the bed, which Lupin had not noticed. One of the flagstones
      moved on a pivot, disclosing a black hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the marquis continued, &ldquo;everything is provided for; and I have
      all that I want at hand, including dungeons: bottomless dungeons, says the
      legend of the castle. So there is nothing to hope for, no help of any
      kind. Will you speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq did not reply; and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the fourth time that I am questioning you, Daubrecq. It is the
      fourth time that I have troubled to ask you for the document which you
      possess, in order that I may escape your blackmailing proceedings. It is
      the fourth time and the last. Will you speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same silence as before. D&rsquo;Albufex made a sign to Sebastiani. The
      huntsman stepped forward, followed by two of his sons. One of them held a
      stick in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Albufex, after waiting a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani slackened the thongs that bound Daubrecq&rsquo;s wrists and inserted
      and fixed the stick between the thongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I turn, monsieur le marquis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A further silence. The marquis waited. Seeing that Daubrecq did not
      flinch, he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you speak? Why expose yourself to physical suffering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn away, Sebastiani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani made the stick turn a complete circle. The thongs stretched and
      tightened. Daubrecq gave a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t speak? Still, you know that I won&rsquo;t give way, that I can&rsquo;t give
      way, that I hold you and that, if necessary, I shall torture you till you
      die of it. You won&rsquo;t speak? You won&rsquo;t?... Sebastiani, once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The huntsman obeyed. Daubrecq gave a violent start of pain and fell back
      on his bed with a rattle in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; cried the marquis, shaking with rage. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak?
      What, haven&rsquo;t you had enough of that list? Surely it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s
      turn! Come, speak... Where is it? One word. One word only... and we will
      leave you in peace... And, to-morrow, when I have the list, you shall be
      free. Free, do you understand? But, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, speak!... Oh, the
      brute! Sebastiani, one more turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani made a fresh effort. The bones cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; cried Daubrecq, in a hoarse voice, vainly struggling to
      release himself. And, in a spluttering whisper, &ldquo;Mercy... mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a dreadful sight... The faces of the three sons were horror-struck.
      Lupin shuddered, sick at heart, and realized that he himself could never
      have accomplished that abominable thing. He listened for the words that
      were bound to come. He must learn the truth. Daubrecq&rsquo;s secret was about
      to be expressed in syllables, in words wrung from him by pain. And Lupin
      began to think of his retreat, of the car which was waiting for him, of
      the wild rush to Paris, of the victory at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; whispered d&rsquo;Albufex. &ldquo;Speak and it will be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... yes...&rdquo; gasped Daubrecq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later... to-morrow...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re mad!... What are you talking about: to-morrow?... Sebastiani,
      another turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; yelled Daubrecq. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then... the paper... I have hidden the paper...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his pain was too great. He raised his head with a last effort, uttered
      incoherent words, succeeded in twice saying, &ldquo;Marie... Marie...&rdquo; and fell
      back, exhausted and lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go at once!&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Albufex to Sebastiani. &ldquo;Hang it all, can we have
      overdone it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a rapid examination showed him that Daubrecq had only fainted.
      Thereupon, he himself, worn out with the excitement, dropped on the foot
      of the bed and, wiping the beads of perspiration from his forehead,
      stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a dirty business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s enough for to-day,&rdquo; said the huntsman, whose rough face
      betrayed a certain emotion. &ldquo;We might try again to-morrow or the next
      day...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was silent. One of the sons handed him a flask of brandy. He
      poured out half a glass and drank it down at a draught:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No. Here and now. One little effort more. At the
      stage which he has reached, it won&rsquo;t be difficult.&rdquo; And, taking the
      huntsman aside, &ldquo;Did you hear what he said? What did he mean by that word,
      &lsquo;Marie&rsquo;? He repeated it twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, twice,&rdquo; said the huntsman. &ldquo;Perhaps he entrusted the document to a
      person called Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he!&rdquo; protested d&rsquo;Albufex. &ldquo;He never entrusts anything to anybody. It
      means something different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what, monsieur le marquis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon find out, I&rsquo;ll answer for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, Daubrecq drew a long breath and stirred on his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Albufex, who had now recovered all his composure and who did not take
      his eyes off the enemy, went up to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Daubrecq, it&rsquo;s madness to resist... Once you&rsquo;re beaten, there&rsquo;s
      nothing for it but to submit to your conqueror, instead of allowing
      yourself to be tortured like an idiot... Come, be sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Sebastiani:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tighten the rope... let him feel it a little that will wake him up...
      He&rsquo;s shamming death...&rdquo; Sebastiani took hold of the stick again and turned
      until the cord touched the swollen flesh. Daubrecq gave a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Sebastiani,&rdquo; said the marquis. &ldquo;Our friend seems favourably
      disposed and understands the need for coming to terms. That&rsquo;s so,
      Daubrecq, is it not? You prefer to have done with it? And you&rsquo;re quite
      right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were leaning over the sufferer, Sebastiani with his hand on
      the stick, d&rsquo;Albufex holding the lamp so as to throw the light on
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s face: &ldquo;His lips are moving... he&rsquo;s going to speak. Loosen the
      rope a little, Sebastiani: I don&rsquo;t want our friend to be hurt... No,
      tighten it: I believe our friend is hesitating... One turn more... stop!
      ... That&rsquo;s done it! Oh, my dear Daubrecq, if you can&rsquo;t speak plainer than
      that, it&rsquo;s no use! What? What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsene Lupin muttered an oath. Daubrecq was speaking and he, Lupin, could
      not hear a word of what he said! In vain, he pricked up his ears,
      suppressed the beating of his heart and the throbbing of his temples: not
      a sound reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I never expected this. What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was within an ace of covering Daubrecq with his revolver and putting a
      bullet into him which would cut short any explanation. But he reflected
      that he himself would then be none the wiser and that it was better to
      trust to events in the hope of making the most of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the confession continued beneath him, indistinctly, interrupted
      by silences and mingled with moans. D&rsquo;Albufex clung to his prey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!... Finish, can&rsquo;t you?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he punctuated the sentences with exclamations of approval:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!... Capital!... Oh, how funny!... And no one suspected?... Not even
      Prasville?... What an ass!... Loosen a bit, Sebastiani: don&rsquo;t you see that
      our friend is out of breath?... Keep calm, Daubrecq... don&rsquo;t tire
      yourself... And so, my dear fellow, you were saying...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the last. There was a long whispering to which d&rsquo;Albufex listened
      without further interruption and of which Arsene Lupin could not catch the
      least syllable. Then the marquis drew himself up and exclaimed, joyfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!... Thank you, Daubrecq. And, believe me, I shall never forget
      what you have just done. If ever you&rsquo;re in need, you have only to knock at
      my door and there will always be a crust of bread for you in the kitchen
      and a glass of water from the filter. Sebastiani, look after monsieur le
      depute as if he were one of your sons. And, first of all, release him from
      his bonds. It&rsquo;s a heartless thing to truss one&rsquo;s fellow-man like that,
      like a chicken on the spit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we give him something to drink?&rdquo; suggested the huntsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, give him a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani and his sons undid the leather straps, rubbed the bruised
      wrists, dressed them with an ointment and bandaged them. Then Daubrecq
      swallowed a few drops of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeling better?&rdquo; said the marquis. &ldquo;Pooh, it&rsquo;s nothing much! In a few
      hours, it won&rsquo;t show; and you&rsquo;ll be able to boast of having been tortured,
      as in the good old days of the Inquisition. You lucky dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out his watch. &ldquo;Enough said! Sebastiani, let your sons watch him
      in turns. You, take me to the station for the last train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then are we to leave him like that, monsieur le marquis, free to move as
      he pleases?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You don&rsquo;t imagine that we are going to keep him here to the day
      of his death? No, Daubrecq, sleep quietly. I shall go to your place
      tomorrow afternoon; and, if the document is where you told me, a telegram
      shall be sent off at once and you shall be set free. You haven&rsquo;t told me a
      lie, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to Daubrecq and, stooping over him again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No humbug, eh? That would be very silly of you. I should lose a day,
      that&rsquo;s all. Whereas you would lose all the days that remain to you to
      live. But no, the hiding-place is too good. A fellow doesn&rsquo;t invent a
      thing like that for fun. Come on, Sebastiani. You shall have the telegram
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose they don&rsquo;t let you into the house, monsieur le marquis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house in the Square Lamartine is occupied by Prasville&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Sebastiani. I shall get in. If they don&rsquo;t open the door,
      there&rsquo;s always the window. And, if the window won&rsquo;t open, I shall arrange
      with one of Prasville&rsquo;s men. It&rsquo;s a question of money, that&rsquo;s all. And,
      thank goodness, I shan&rsquo;t be short of that, henceforth! Good-night,
      Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out, accompanied by Sebastiani, and the heavy door closed after
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin at once effected his retreat, in accordance with a plan which he had
      worked out during this scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was simple enough: to scramble, by means of his rope, to the
      bottom of the cliff, take his friends with him, jump into the motor-car
      and attack d&rsquo;Albufex and Sebastiani on the deserted road that leads to
      Aumale Station. There could be no doubt about the issue of the contest.
      With d&rsquo;Albufex and Sebastiani prisoners; it would be an easy matter to
      make one of them speak. D&rsquo;Albufex had shown him how to set about it; and
      Clarisse Mergy would be inflexible where it was a question of saving her
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the rope with which he had provided himself and groped about to
      find a jagged piece of rock round which to pass it, so as to leave two
      equal lengths hanging, by which he could let himself down. But, when he
      found what he wanted, instead of acting swiftly&mdash;for the business was
      urgent&mdash;he stood motionless, thinking. His scheme failed to satisfy
      him at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd, what I&rsquo;m proposing,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Absurd and
      illogical. How can I tell that d&rsquo;Albufex and Sebastiani will not escape
      me? How can I even tell that, once they are in my power, they will speak?
      No, I shall stay. There are better things to try... much better things.
      It&rsquo;s not those two I must be at, but Daubrecq. He&rsquo;s done for; he has not a
      kick left in him. If he has told the marquis his secret, there is no
      reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t tell it to Clarisse and me, when we employ the
      same methods. That&rsquo;s settled! We&rsquo;ll kidnap the Daubrecq bird.&rdquo; And he
      continued, &ldquo;Besides, what do I risk? If the scheme miscarries, Clarisse
      and I will rush off to Paris and, together with Prasville, organize a
      careful watch in the Square Lamartine to prevent d&rsquo;Albufex from benefiting
      by Daubrecq&rsquo;s revelations. The great thing is for Prasville to be warned
      of the danger. He shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The church-clock in a neighbouring village struck twelve. That gave Lupin
      six or seven hours to put his new plan into execution. He set to work
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      When moving away from the embrasure which had the window at the bottom of
      it, he had come upon a clump of small shrubs in one of the hollows of the
      cliff. He cut away a dozen of these, with his knife, and whittled them all
      down to the same size. Then he cut off two equal lengths from his rope.
      These were the uprights of the ladder. He fastened the twelve little
      sticks between the uprights and thus contrived a rope-ladder about six
      yards long.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to this post, there was only one of the three sons beside
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s bed in the torture-chamber. He was smoking his pipe by the
      lamp. Daubrecq was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; thought Lupin. &ldquo;Is the fellow going to sit there all night? In
      that case, there&rsquo;s nothing for me to do but to slip off...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea that d&rsquo;Albufex was in possession of the secret vexed him
      mightily. The interview at which he had assisted had left the clear
      impression in his mind that the marquis was working &ldquo;on his own&rdquo; and that,
      in securing the list, he intended not only to escape Daubrecq&rsquo;s activity,
      but also to gain Daubrecq&rsquo;s power and build up his fortune anew by the
      identical means which Daubrecq had employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would have meant, for Lupin, a fresh battle to wage against a fresh
      enemy. The rapid march of events did not allow of the contemplation of
      such a possibility. He must at all costs spike the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex&rsquo; guns
      by warning Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Lupin remained held back by the stubborn hope of some incident
      that would give him the opportunity of acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck half-past twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiting became terrible, all the more so as an icy mist rose from the
      valley and Lupin felt the cold penetrate to his very marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the trot of a horse in the distance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sebastiani returning from the station,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the son who was watching in the torture-chamber, having finished his
      packet of tobacco, opened the door and asked his brothers if they had a
      pipeful for him. They made some reply; and he went out to go to the lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lupin was astounded. No sooner was the door closed than Daubrecq, who
      had been so sound asleep, sat up on his couch, listened, put one foot to
      the ground, followed by the other, and, standing up, tottering a little,
      but firmer on his legs than one would have expected, tried his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;the beggar doesn&rsquo;t take long recovering. He can very
      well help in his own escape. There&rsquo;s just one point that ruffles me: will
      he allow himself to be convinced? Will he consent to go with me? Will he
      not think that this miraculous assistance which comes to him straight from
      heaven is a trap laid by the marquis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly Lupin remembered the letter which he had made Daubrecq&rsquo;s old
      cousins write, the letter of recommendation, so to speak, which the elder
      of the two sisters Rousselot had signed with her Christian name,
      Euphrasie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in his pocket. He took it and listened. Not a sound, except the
      faint noise of Daubrecq&rsquo;s footsteps on the flagstones. Lupin considered
      that the moment had come. He thrust his arm through the bars and threw the
      letter in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq seemed thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter had fluttered through the room and lay on the floor, at three
      steps from him. Where did it come from? He raised his head toward the
      window and tried to pierce the darkness that hid all the upper part of the
      room from his eyes. Then he looked at the envelope, without yet daring to
      touch it, as though he dreaded a snare. Then, suddenly, after a glance at
      the door, he stooped briskly, seized the envelope and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh of delight, when he saw the signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the letter half-aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Rely implicitly on the bearer of this note.  He has succeeded
 in discovering the marquis&rsquo; secret, with the money which we gave
 him, and has contrived a plan of escape.  Everything is prepared
 for your flight.

       &ldquo;EUPHRASIE ROUSSELOT&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He read the letter again, repeated, &ldquo;Euphrasie... Euphrasie...&rdquo; and raised
      his head once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take me two or three hours to file through one of the bars. Are
      Sebastiani and his sons coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are sure to,&rdquo; replied Daubrecq, in the same low voice, &ldquo;but I
      expect they will leave me to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they sleep next door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the door is too thick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. In that case, it will soon be done. I have a rope-ladder. Will
      you be able to climb up alone, without my assistance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so... I&rsquo;ll try... It&rsquo;s my wrists that they&rsquo;ve broken... Oh, the
      brutes! I can hardly move my hands... and I have very little strength
      left. But I&rsquo;ll try all the same... needs must...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, listened and, with his finger to his mouth, whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Sebastiani and his sons entered the room, Daubrecq, who had hidden
      the letter and lain down on his bed, pretended to wake with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huntsman brought him a bottle of wine, a glass and some food:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How goes it, monsieur le depute?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well, perhaps we did squeeze
      a little hard... It&rsquo;s very painful, that thumbscrewing. Seems they often
      did it at the time of the Great Revolution and Bonaparte... in the days of
      the chauffeurs. [*] A pretty invention! Nice and clean... no bloodshed...
      And it didn&rsquo;t last long either! In twenty minutes, you came out with the
      missing word!&rdquo; Sebastiani burst out laughing. &ldquo;By the way, monsieur le
      depute, my congratulations! A capital hiding-place. Who would ever suspect
      it?... You see, what put us off, monsieur le marquis and me, was that name
      of Marie which you let out at first. You weren&rsquo;t telling a lie; but there
      you are, you know: the word was only half-finished. We had to know the
      rest. Say what you like, it&rsquo;s amusing! Just think, on your study-table!
      Upon my word, what a joke!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name given to the brigands in the Vendee, who tortured
     their victims with fire to make them confess where their
     money was hidden.&mdash;Translator&rsquo;s Note.
</pre>
    <p>
      The huntsman rose and walked up and down the room, rubbing his hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le marquis is jolly well pleased, so pleased, in fact, that he
      himself is coming to-morrow evening to let you out. Yes, he has thought it
      over; there will be a few formalities: you may have to sign a cheque or
      two, stump up, what, and make good monsieur le marquis&rsquo; expense and
      trouble. But what&rsquo;s that to you? A trifle! Not to mention that, from now
      on, there will be no more chains, no more straps round your wrists; in
      short, you will be treated like a king! And I&rsquo;ve even been told&mdash;look
      here!&mdash;to allow you a good bottle of old wine and a flask of brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiani let fly a few more jests, then took the lamp, made a last
      examination of the room and said to his sons:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave him to sleep. You also, take a rest, all three of you. But
      sleep with one eye open. One never can tell...&rdquo; They withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin waited a little longer and asked, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but be careful. It&rsquo;s not impossible that they may go on a round in
      an hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin set to work. He had a very powerful file; and the iron of the bars,
      rusted and gnawed away by time, was, in places, almost reduced to dust.
      Twice Lupin stopped to listen, with ears pricked up. But it was only the
      patter of a rat over the rubbish in the upper story, or the flight of some
      night-bird; and he continued his task, encouraged by Daubrecq, who stood
      by the door, ready to warn him at the least alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; he said, giving a last stroke of the file. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over,
      for, on my word, I&rsquo;ve been a bit cramped in this cursed tunnel... to say
      nothing of the cold...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bore with all his strength upon the bar, which he had sawn from below,
      and succeeded in forcing it down sufficiently for a man&rsquo;s body to slip
      between the two remaining bars. Next, he had to go back to the end of the
      embrasure, the wider part, where he had left the rope-ladder. After fixing
      it to the bars, he called Daubrecq:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psst!... It&rsquo;s all right... Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... coming... One more second, while I listen... All right... They&rsquo;re
      asleep... give me the ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin lowered it and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... I feel a little weak... but I shall manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, he reached the window of the embrasure pretty quickly and crept
      along the passage in the wake of his rescuer. The open air, however,
      seemed to make him giddy. Also, to give himself strength, he had drunk
      half the bottle of wine; and he had a fainting-fit that kept him lying on
      the stones of the embrasure for half an hour. Lupin, losing patience, was
      fastening him to one end of the rope, of which the other end was knotted
      round the bars and was preparing to let him down like a bale of goods,
      when Daubrecq woke up, in better condition:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel fit now. Will it take long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty long. We are a hundred and fifty yards up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it that d&rsquo;Albufex did not foresee that it was possible to escape
      this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cliff is perpendicular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were able to...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your cousins insisted... And then one has to live, you know, and
      they were free with their money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear, good souls!&rdquo; said Daubrecq. &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down below, in a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a river, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we won&rsquo;t talk, if you don&rsquo;t mind. It&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more. Had you been there long when you threw me the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. A quarter of an hour or so. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it...
      Meanwhile, we must hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin went first, after recommending Daubrecq to hold tight to the rope
      and to come down backward. He would give him a hand at the difficult
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took them over forty minutes to reach the platform of the ledge formed
      by the cliff; and Lupin had several times to help his companion, whose
      wrists, still bruised from the torture, had lost all their strength and
      suppleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over again, he groaned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the swine, they&rsquo;ve done for me!... The swine!... Ah, d&rsquo;Albufex, I&rsquo;ll
      make you pay dear for this!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; said Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noise... up above...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing motionless on the platform, they listened. Lupin thought of the
      Sire de Tancarville and the sentry who had killed him with a shot from his
      harquebus. He shivered, feeling all the anguish of the silence and the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was mistaken... Besides, it&rsquo;s absurd... They can&rsquo;t hit
      us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would hit us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one... no one... it was a silly notion...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He groped about till he found the uprights of the ladder; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, here&rsquo;s the ladder. It is fixed in the bed of the river. A friend
      of mine is looking after it, as well as your cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whistled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice. &ldquo;Hold the ladder fast.&rdquo; And, to
      Daubrecq, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq objected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would be better for me to go down first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very tired. You can tie your rope round my waist and hold me...
      Otherwise, there is a danger that I might...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Come nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq came nearer and knelt down on the rock. Lupin fastened the rope
      to him and then, stooping over, grasped one of the uprights in both hands
      to keep the ladder from shaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off you go,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, he felt a violent pain in the shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast it!&rdquo; he said, sinking to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had stabbed him with a knife below the nape of the neck, a little
      to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You blackguard! You blackguard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He half-saw Daubrecq, in the dark, ridding himself of his rope, and heard
      him whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit of a fool, you know!... You bring me a letter from my
      Rousselot cousins, in which I recognize the writing of the elder,
      Adelaide, but which that sly puss of an Adelaide, suspecting something and
      meaning to put me on my guard, if necessary, took care to sign with the
      name of the younger sister, Euphrasie Rousselot. You see, I tumbled to it!
      So, with a little reflection... you are Master Arsene Lupin, are you not?
      Clarisse&rsquo;s protector, Gilbert&rsquo;s saviour... Poor Lupin, I fear you&rsquo;re in a
      bad way... I don&rsquo;t use the knife often; but, when I do, I use it with a
      vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over the wounded man and felt in his pockets:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your revolver, can&rsquo;t you? You see, your friends will know at once
      that it is not their governor; and they will try to secure me... And, as I
      have not much strength left, a bullet or two... Good-bye, Lupin. We shall
      meet in the next world, eh? Book me a nice flat, with all the latest
      conveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Lupin. And my best thanks. For really I don&rsquo;t know what I
      should have done without you. By Jove, d&rsquo;Albufex was hitting me hard!
      It&rsquo;ll be a joke to meet the beggar again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had completed his preparations. He whistled once more. A reply
      came from the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a last effort, Lupin put out his arm to stop him. But his hand
      touched nothing but space. He tried to call out, to warn his accomplices:
      his voice choked in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a terrible numbness creep over his whole being. His temples
      buzzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, shouts below. Then a shot. Then another, followed by a
      triumphant chuckle. And a woman&rsquo;s wail and moans. And, soon after, two
      more shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin thought of Clarisse, wounded, dead perhaps; of Daubrecq, fleeing
      victoriously; of d&rsquo;Albufex; of the crystal stopper, which one or other of
      the two adversaries would recover unresisted. Then a sudden vision showed
      him the Sire de Tancarville falling with the woman he loved. Then he
      murmured, time after time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clarisse... Clarisse... Gilbert...&rdquo; A great silence overcame him; an
      infinite peace entered into him; and, without the least revolt, he
      received the impression that his exhausted body, with nothing now to hold
      it back, was rolling to the very edge of the rock, toward the abyss.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. IN THE DARK
    </h2>
    <h3>
      An hotel bedroom at Amiens.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lupin was recovering a little consciousness for the first time. Clarisse
      and the Masher were seated by his bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were talking; and Lupin listened to them, without opening his eyes.
      He learned that they had feared for his life, but that all danger was now
      removed. Next, in the course of the conversation, he caught certain words
      that revealed to him what had happened in the tragic night at Mortepierre:
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s descent; the dismay of the accomplices, when they saw that it
      was not the governor; then the short struggle: Clarisse flinging herself
      on Daubrecq and receiving a wound in the shoulder; Daubrecq leaping to the
      bank; the Growler firing two revolver-shots and darting off in pursuit of
      him; the Masher clambering up the ladder and finding the governor in a
      swoon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True as I live,&rdquo; said the Masher, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out even now how he did
      not roll over. There was a sort of hollow at that place, but it was a
      sloping hollow; and, half dead as he was, he must have hung on with his
      ten fingers. Crikey, it was time I came!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin listened, listened in despair. He collected his strength to grasp
      and understand the words. But suddenly a terrible sentence was uttered:
      Clarisse, weeping, spoke of the eighteen days that had elapsed, eighteen
      more days lost to Gilbert&rsquo;s safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen days! The figure terrified Lupin. He felt that all was over, that
      he would never be able to recover his strength and resume the struggle and
      that Gilbert and Vaucheray were doomed... His brain slipped away from him.
      The fever returned and the delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      And more days came and went. It was perhaps the time of his life of which
      Lupin speaks with the greatest horror. He retained just enough
      consciousness and had sufficiently lucid moments to realize the position
      exactly. But he was not able to coordinate his ideas, to follow a line of
      argument nor to instruct or forbid his friends to adopt this or that line
      of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, when he emerged from his torpor, he found his hand in Clarisse&rsquo;s
      and, in that half-slumbering condition in which a fever keeps you, he
      would address strange words to her, words of love and passion, imploring
      her and thanking her and blessing her for all the light and joy which she
      had brought into his darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, growing calmer and not fully understanding what he had said, he
      tried to jest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been delirious, have I not? What a heap of nonsense I must have
      talked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lupin felt by Clarisse&rsquo;s silence that he could safely talk as much
      nonsense as ever his fever suggested to him. She did not hear. The care
      and attention which she lavished on the patient, her devotion, her
      vigilance, her alarm at the least relapse: all this was meant not for him,
      but for the possible saviour of Gilbert. She anxiously watched the
      progress of his convalescence. How soon would he be fit to resume the
      campaign? Was it not madness to linger by his side, when every day carried
      away a little hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin never ceased repeating to himself, with the inward belief that, by
      so doing, he could influence the course of his illness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get well... I will get well...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he lay for days on end without moving, so as not to disturb the
      dressing of his wound nor increase the excitement of his nerves in the
      smallest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also strove not to think of Daubrecq. But the image of his dire
      adversary haunted him; and he reconstituted the various phases of the
      escape, the descent of the cliff.... One day, struck by a terrible memory,
      he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The list! The list of the Twenty-seven! Daubrecq must have it by now...
      or else d&rsquo;Albufex. It was on the table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse reassured him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can have taken it,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;The Growler was in Paris that
      same day, with a note from me for Prasville, entreating him to redouble
      his watch in the Square Lamartine, so that no one should enter, especially
      d&rsquo;Albufex...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Daubrecq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is wounded. He cannot have gone home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right!... But you too were wounded...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere scratch on the shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin was easier in his mind after these revelations. Nevertheless, he was
      pursued by stubborn notions which he was unable either to drive from his
      brain or to put into words. Above all, he thought incessantly of that name
      of &ldquo;Marie&rdquo; which Daubrecq&rsquo;s sufferings had drawn from him. What did the
      name refer to? Was it the title of one of the books on the shelves, or a
      part of the title? Would the book in question supply the key to the
      mystery? Or was it the combination word of a safe? Was it a series of
      letters written somewhere: on a wall, on a paper, on a wooden panel, on
      the mount of a drawing, on an invoice?
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions, to which he was unable to find a reply, obsessed and
      exhausted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Arsene Lupin woke feeling a great deal better. The wound was
      closed, the temperature almost normal. The doctor, a personal friend, who
      came every day from Paris, promised that he might get up two days later.
      And, on that day, in the absence of his accomplices and of Mme. Mergy, all
      three of whom had left two days before, in quest of information, he had
      himself moved to the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt life return to him with the sunlight, with the balmy air that
      announced the approach of spring. He recovered the concatenation of his
      ideas; and facts once more took their place in his brain in their logical
      sequence and in accordance with their relations one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he received a telegram from Clarisse to say that things
      were going badly and that she, the Growler and the Masher were all staying
      in Paris. He was much disturbed by this wire and had a less quiet night.
      What could the news be that had given rise to Clarisse&rsquo;s telegram?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the next day, she arrived in his room looking very pale, her eyes red
      with weeping, and, utterly worn out, dropped into a chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The appeal has been rejected,&rdquo; she stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mastered his emotion and asked, in a voice of surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you relying on that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but, all the same... one hopes in spite of one&rsquo;s
      self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it rejected yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week ago. The Masher kept it from me; and I have not dared to read the
      papers lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always the commutation of sentence,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commutation? Do you imagine that they will commute the sentence of
      Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s accomplices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ejaculated the words with a violence and a bitterness which he
      pretended not to notice; and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaucheray perhaps not... But they will take pity on Gilbert, on his
      youth...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will do nothing of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen his counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen his counsel! And you told him...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that I was Gilbert&rsquo;s mother and I asked him whether, by
      proclaiming my son&rsquo;s identity, we could not influence the result... or at
      least delay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would do that?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You would admit...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert&rsquo;s life comes before everything. What do I care about my name!
      What do I care about my husband&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your little Jacques?&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Have you the right to ruin
      Jacques, to make him the brother of a man condemned to death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hung her head. And he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the counsel say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that an act of that sort would not help Gilbert in the remotest
      degree. And, in spite of all his protests, I could see that, as far as he
      was concerned, he had no illusions left and that the pardoning commission
      are bound to find in favour of the execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commission, I grant you; but what of the president of the Republic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The president always goes by the advice of the commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not do so this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we shall bring influence to bear upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the conditional surrender of the list of the Twenty-seven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I shall have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His certainty had not wavered. He made the statement with equal calmness
      and faith in the infinite power of his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lost some part of her confidence in him and she shrugged her
      shoulders lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If d&rsquo;Albufex has not purloined the list, one man alone can exercise any
      influence; one man alone: Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke these words in a low and absent voice that made him shudder. Was
      she still thinking, as he had often seemed to feel, of going back to
      Daubrecq and paying him for Gilbert&rsquo;s life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sworn an oath to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reminding you of it. It was
      agreed that the struggle with Daubrecq should be directed by me and that
      there would never be a possibility of any arrangement between you and
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She retorted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know where he is. If I knew, wouldn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an evasive answer. But he did not insist, resolving to watch her at
      the opportune time; and he asked her, for he had not yet been told all the
      details:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s not known what became of Daubrecq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Of course, one of the Growler&rsquo;s bullets struck him. For, next day, we
      picked up, in a coppice, a handkerchief covered with blood. Also, it seems
      that a man was seen at Aumale Station, looking very tired and walking with
      great difficulty. He took a ticket for Paris, stepped into the first train
      and that is all...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be seriously wounded,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;and he is nursing himself in
      some safe retreat. Perhaps, also, he considers it wise to lie low for a
      few weeks and avoid any traps on the part of the police, d&rsquo;Albufex, you,
      myself and all his other enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to think and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened at Mortepierre since Daubrecq&rsquo;s escape? Has there been
      no talk in the neighbourhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the rope was removed before daybreak, which proves that Sebastiani or
      his sons discovered Daubrecq&rsquo;s flight on the same night. Sebastiani was
      away the whole of the next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he will have informed the marquis. And where is the marquis
      himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home. And, from what the Growler has heard, there is nothing
      suspicious there either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they certain that he has not been inside Daubrecq&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As certain as they can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor Daubrecq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Prasville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prasville is away on leave. But Chief-inspector Blanchon, who has charge
      of the case, and the detectives who are guarding the house declare that,
      in accordance with Prasville&rsquo;s instructions, their watch is not relaxed
      for a moment, even at night; that one of them, turn and turn about, is
      always on duty in the study; and that no one, therefore, can have gone
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, on principle,&rdquo; Arsene Lupin concluded, &ldquo;the crystal stopper must
      still be in Daubrecq&rsquo;s study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was there before Daubrecq&rsquo;s disappearance, it should be there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on the study-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the study-table? Why do you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know,&rdquo; said Lupin, who had not forgotten Sebastiani&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know the article in which the stopper is hidden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But a study-table, a writing-desk, is a limited space. One can
      explore it in twenty minutes. One can demolish it, if necessary, in ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation had tired Arsene Lupin a little. As he did not wish to
      commit the least imprudence, he said to Clarisse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen. I will ask you to give me two or three days more. This is Monday,
      the 4th of March. On Wednesday or Thursday, at latest, I shall be up and
      about. And you can be sure that we shall succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in the meantime...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime, go back to Paris. Take rooms, with the Growler and the
      Masher, in the Hotel Franklin, near the Trocadero, and keep a watch on
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s house. You are free to go in and out as you please. Stimulate
      the zeal of the detectives on duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Daubrecq returns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he returns, that will be so much the better: we shall have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, if he only passes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, the Growler and the Masher must follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they lose sight of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not reply. No one felt more than he how fatal it was to remain
      inactive in a hotel bedroom and how useful his presence would have been on
      the battlefield! Perhaps even this vague idea had already prolonged his
      illness beyond the ordinary limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go now, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a constraint between them which increased as the awful day drew
      nigh. In her injustice, forgetting or wishing to forget that it was she
      who had forced her son into the Enghien enterprise, Mme. Mergy did not
      forget that the law was pursuing Gilbert with such rigour not so much
      because he was a criminal as because he was an accomplice of Arsene
      Lupin&rsquo;s. And then, notwithstanding all his efforts, notwithstanding his
      prodigious expenditure of energy, what result had Lupin achieved, when all
      was said? How far had his intervention benefited Gilbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, she rose and left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he was feeling rather low. But on the day after, the
      Wednesday, when his doctor wanted him to keep quiet until the end of the
      week, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, what have I to fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A return of the fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The wound is pretty well healed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ll go back with you in your car. We shall be in
      Paris by mid-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What decided Lupin to start at once was, first, a letter in which Clarisse
      told him that she had found Daubrecq&rsquo;s traces, and, also, a telegram,
      published in the Amiens papers, which stated that the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex
      had been arrested for his complicity in the affair of the canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq was taking his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the fact that Daubrecq was taking his revenge proved that the marquis
      had not been able to prevent that revenge by seizing the document which
      was on the writing-desk in the study. It proved that Chief-inspector
      Blanchon and the detectives had kept a good watch. It proved that the
      crystal stopper was still in the Square Lamartine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still there; and this showed either that Daubrecq had not ventured
      to go home, or else that his state of health hindered him from doing so,
      or else again that he had sufficient confidence in the hiding-place not to
      trouble to put himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, there was no doubt as to the course to be pursued: Lupin must
      act and he must act smartly. He must forestall Daubrecq and get hold of
      the crystal stopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had crossed the Bois de Boulogne and were nearing the Square
      Lamartine, Lupin took leave of the doctor and stopped the car. The Growler
      and the Masher, to whom he had wired, met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mme. Mergy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not been back since yesterday; she sent us an express message to
      say that she saw Daubrecq leaving his cousins&rsquo; place and getting into a
      cab. She knows the number of the cab and will keep us informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing further?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Paris-Midi says that d&rsquo;Albufex opened his veins last night, with
      a piece of broken glass, in his cell at the Sante. He seems to have left a
      long letter behind him, confessing his fault, but accusing Daubrecq of his
      death and exposing the part played by Daubrecq in the canal affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The same paper stated that it has reason to believe that the
      pardoning commission, after examining the record, has rejected Vaucheray
      and Gilbert&rsquo;s petition and that their counsel will probably be received in
      audience by the president on Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin gave a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re losing no time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can see that Daubrecq, on the very
      first day, put the screw on the old judicial machine. One short week
      more... and the knife falls. My poor Gilbert! If, on Friday next, the
      papers which your counsel submits to the president of the Republic do not
      contain the conditional offer of the list of the Twenty-seven, then, my
      poor Gilbert, you are done for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, governor, are you losing courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Rot! I shall have the crystal stopper in an hour. In two hours, I
      shall see Gilbert&rsquo;s counsel. And the nightmare will be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, governor! That&rsquo;s like your old self. Shall we wait for you
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, go back to your hotel. I&rsquo;ll join you later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted. Lupin walked straight to the house and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A detective opened the door and recognized him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Nicole, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is Chief-inspector Blanchon here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man took him to the study, where Chief-inspector Blanchon welcomed him
      with obvious pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, chief-inspector, one would say there was something new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Nicole, my orders are to place myself entirely at your disposal; and I
      may say that I am very glad to see you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there is something new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq has returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what!&rdquo; exclaimed Lupin, with a start. &ldquo;Daubrecq returned? Is he
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he come in here, in the study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did not prevent him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right had I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you left him alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By his positive orders, yes, we left him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin felt himself turn pale. Daubrecq had come back to fetch the crystal
      stopper!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for some time and repeated to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came back to fetch it... He was afraid that it would be found and he
      has taken it... Of course, it was inevitable... with d&rsquo;Albufex arrested,
      with d&rsquo;Albufex accused and accusing him, Daubrecq was bound to defend
      himself. It&rsquo;s a difficult game for him. After months and months of
      mystery, the public is at last learning that the infernal being who
      contrived the whole tragedy of the Twenty-Seven and who ruins and kills
      his adversaries is he, Daubrecq. What would become of him if, by a
      miracle, his talisman did not protect him? He has taken it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, trying to make his voice sound firm, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he stay long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty seconds, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Twenty seconds? No longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could he have known of the Marquis d&rsquo;Albufex&rsquo; suicide by then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I saw the special edition of the Paris-Midi in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Lupin. And he asked, &ldquo;Did M. Prasville give
      you no special instructions in case Daubrecq should return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. So, in M. Prasville&rsquo;s absence, I telephoned to the police-office and
      I am waiting. The disappearance of Daubrecq the deputy caused a great
      stir, as you know, and our presence here has a reason, in the eyes of the
      public, as long as that disappearance continues. But, now that Daubrecq
      has returned, now that we have proofs that he is neither under restraint
      nor dead, how can we stay in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Lupin, absently. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the
      house is guarded or not. Daubrecq has been; therefore the crystal stopper
      is no longer here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not finished the sentence, when a question quite naturally forced
      itself upon his mind. If the crystal stopper was no longer there, would
      this not be obvious from some material sign? Had the removal of that
      object, doubtless contained within another object, left no trace, no void?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to ascertain. Lupin had simply to examine the writing-desk,
      for he knew, from Sebastiani&rsquo;s chaff, that this was the spot of the
      hiding-place. And the hiding-place could not be a complicated one, seeing
      that Daubrecq had not remained in the study for more than twenty seconds,
      just long enough, so to speak, to walk in and walk out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin looked. And the result was immediate. His memory had so faithfully
      recorded the picture of the desk, with all the articles lying on it, that
      the absence of one of them struck him instantaneously, as though that
      article and that alone were the characteristic sign which distinguished
      this particular writing-table from every other table in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he thought, quivering with delight, &ldquo;everything fits in! Everything!
      ... Down to that half-word which the torture drew from Daubrecq in the
      tower at Mortepierre! The riddle is solved. There need be no more
      hesitation, no more groping in the dark. The end is in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, without answering the inspector&rsquo;s questions, he thought of the
      simplicity of the hiding-place and remembered Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s wonderful
      story in which the stolen letter, so eagerly sought for, is, in a manner
      of speaking, displayed to all eyes. People do not suspect what does not
      appear to be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Lupin, as he went out, greatly excited by his
      discovery, &ldquo;I seem doomed, in this confounded adventure, to knock up
      against disappointments to the finish. Everything that I build crumbles to
      pieces at once. Every victory ends in disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he did not allow himself to be cast down. On the one hand,
      he now knew where Daubrecq the deputy hid the crystal stopper. On the
      other hand, he would soon learn from Clarisse Mergy where Daubrecq himself
      was lurking. The rest, to him, would be child&rsquo;s play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Growler and the Masher were waiting for him in the drawing-room of the
      Hotel Franklin, a small family-hotel near the Trocadero. Mme. Mergy had
      not yet written to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can trust her! She will hang on to Daubrecq until she is
      certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, toward the end of the afternoon, he began to grow impatient and
      anxious. He was fighting one of those battles&mdash;the last, he hoped&mdash;in
      which the least delay might jeopardize everything. If Daubrecq threw Mme.
      Mergy off the scent, how was he to be caught again? They no longer had
      weeks or days, but only a few hours, a terribly limited number of hours,
      in which to repair any mistakes that they might commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the proprietor of the hotel and asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that there is no express letter for my two friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor for me, M. Nicole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;We were certain that we should hear from
      Mme. Audran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Audran was the name under which Clarisse was staying at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lady has been,&rdquo; said the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came some time ago and, as the gentlemen were not there, left a
      letter in her room. Didn&rsquo;t the porter tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin and his friends hurried upstairs. There was a letter on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been opened! How is that? And why has it been
      cut about with scissors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter contained the following lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Daubrecq has spent the week at the Hotel Central.  This morning
 he had his luggage taken to the Gare de &mdash;-  and telephoned to
 reserve a berth in the sleeping-car &mdash;- for &mdash;-

 &ldquo;I do not know when the train starts.  But I shall be at the
 station all the afternoon.  Come as soon as you can, all three
 of you.  We will arrange to kidnap him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; said the Masher. &ldquo;At which station? And where&rsquo;s the
      sleeping-car for? She has cut out just the words we wanted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Growler. &ldquo;Two snips with the scissors in each place; and
      the words which we most want are gone. Who ever saw such a thing? Has Mme.
      Mergy lost her head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not move. A rush of blood was beating at his temples with such
      violence that he glued his fists to them and pressed with all his might.
      His fever returned, burning and riotous, and his will, incensed to the
      verge of physical suffering, concentrated itself upon that stealthy enemy,
      which must be controlled then and there, if he himself did not wish to be
      irretrievably beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      He muttered, very calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq has been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t suppose that Mme. Mergy has been amusing herself by cutting out
      those two words. Daubrecq has been here. Mme. Mergy thought that she was
      watching him. He was watching her instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless through that hall-porter who did not tell us that Mme. Mergy
      had been to the hotel, but who must have told Daubrecq. He came. He read
      the letter. And, by way of getting at us, he contented himself with
      cutting out the essential words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can find out... we can ask...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good? What&rsquo;s the use of finding out how he came, when we know
      that he did come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He examined the letter for some time, turned it over and over, then stood
      up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gare de Lyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of nothing with Daubrecq. But, as we have to choose, according
      to the contents of the letter, between the Gare de l&rsquo;Est and the Gare de
      Lyon, [*] I am presuming that his business, his pleasure and his health
      are more likely to take Daubrecq in the direction of Marseilles and the
      Riviera than to the Gare de l&rsquo;Est.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * These are the only two main-line stations in Paris with the
     word de in their name.  The others have du, as the Gare du
     Nord or the Gare du Luxembourg, d&rsquo; as the Gare d&rsquo;Orleans, or
     no participle at all, as the Gare Saint-Lazare or the Gare
     Montparnasse.&mdash;Translator&rsquo;s Note.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was past seven when Lupin and his companions left the Hotel Franklin. A
      motor-car took them across Paris at full speed, but they soon saw that
      Clarisse Mergy was not outside the station, nor in the waiting-rooms, nor
      on any of the platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; muttered Lupin, whose agitation grew as the obstacles increased,
      &ldquo;still, if Daubrecq booked a berth in a sleeping-car, it can only have
      been in an evening train. And it is barely half-past seven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A train was starting, the night express. They had time to rush along the
      corridor. Nobody... neither Mme. Mergy nor Daubrecq...
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as they were all three going, a porter accosted them near the
      refreshment-room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is one of you gentlemen looking for a lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,... I am,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Quick, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, sir! The lady told me there might be three of you or two of
      you.... And I didn&rsquo;t know...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in heaven&rsquo;s name, speak, man! What lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady who spent the whole day on the pavement, with the luggage,
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, out with it! Has she taken a train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the train-de-luxe, at six-thirty: she made up her mind at the last
      moment, she told me to say. And I was also to say that the gentleman was
      in the same train and that they were going to Monte Carlo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; muttered Lupin. &ldquo;We ought to have taken the express just now!
      There&rsquo;s nothing left but the evening trains, and they crawl! We&rsquo;ve lost
      over three hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wait seemed interminable. They booked their seats. They telephoned to
      the proprietor of the Hotel Franklin to send on their letters to Monte
      Carlo. They dined. They read the papers. At last, at half-past nine, the
      train started.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, by a really tragic series of circumstances, at the most critical
      moment of the contest, Lupin was turning his back on the battlefield and
      going away, at haphazard, to seek, he knew not where, and beat, he knew
      not how, the most formidable and elusive enemy that he had ever fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was happening four days, five days at most, before the inevitable
      execution of Gilbert and Vaucheray.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bad and painful night for Lupin. The more he studied the
      situation the more terrible it appeared to him. On every side he was faced
      with uncertainty, darkness, confusion, helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he knew the secret of the crystal stopper. But how was he to know
      that Daubrecq would not change or had not already changed his tactics? How
      was he to know that the list of the Twenty-seven was still inside that
      crystal stopper or that the crystal stopper was still inside the object
      where Daubrecq had first hidden it?
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a further serious reason for alarm in the fact that Clarisse
      Mergy thought that she was shadowing and watching Daubrecq at a time when,
      on the contrary, Daubrecq was watching her, having her shadowed and
      dragging her, with diabolical cleverness, toward the places selected by
      himself, far from all help or hope of help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Daubrecq&rsquo;s game was clear as daylight! Did not Lupin know the unhappy
      woman&rsquo;s hesitations? Did he not know&mdash;and the Growler and the Masher
      confirmed it most positively&mdash;that Clarisse looked upon the infamous
      bargain planned by Daubrecq in the light of a possible, an acceptable
      thing? In that case, how could he, Lupin, succeed? The logic of events, so
      powerfully moulded by Daubrecq, led to a fatal result: the mother must
      sacrifice herself and, to save her son, throw her scruples, her
      repugnance, her very honour, to the winds!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you scoundrel!&rdquo; snarled Lupin, in a fit of rage. &ldquo;If I get hold of
      you, I&rsquo;ll make you dance to a pretty tune! I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your shoes for
      a great deal, when that happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached Monte Carlo at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Lupin was at
      once disappointed not to see Clarisse on the platform at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited. No messenger came up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked the porters and ticket-collectors if they had noticed, among the
      crowd, two travellers answering to the description of Daubrecq and
      Clarisse. They had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, therefore, to set to work and hunt through all the hotels and
      lodging-houses in the principality. Oh, the time wasted!
    </p>
    <p>
      By the following evening, Lupin knew, beyond a doubt, that Daubrecq and
      Clarisse were not at Monte Carlo, nor at Monaco, nor at the Cap d&rsquo;Ail, nor
      at La Turbie, nor at Cap Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can they be then?&rdquo; he wondered, trembling with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, on the Saturday, he received, at the poste restante, a telegram
      which had been readdressed from the Hotel Franklin and which said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;He got out at Cannes and is going on to San Remo, Hotel Palace
 des Ambassadeurs.

         &ldquo;CLARISSE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The telegram was dated the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; exclaimed Lupin. &ldquo;They passed through Monte Carlo. One of us
      ought to have remained at the station. I did think of it; but, in the
      midst of all that bustle...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin and his friends took the first train for Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the frontier at twelve o&rsquo;clock. The train entered the station
      at San Remo at twelve-forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      They at once saw an hotel-porter, with &ldquo;Ambassadeurs-Palace&rdquo; on his
      braided cap, who seemed to be looking for some one among the arrivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin went up to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you looking for M. Nicole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. Nicole and two gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mme. Mergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she staying at your hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She did not get out. She beckoned to me, described you three
      gentlemen and told me to say that she was going on to Genoa, to the Hotel
      Continental.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she by herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin tipped the man, dismissed him and turned to his friends:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Saturday. If the execution takes place on Monday, there&rsquo;s nothing
      to be done. But Monday is not a likely day... What I have to do is to lay
      hands on Daubrecq to-night and to be in Paris on Monday, with the
      document. It&rsquo;s our last chance. Let&rsquo;s take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Growler went to the booking-office and returned with three tickets for
      Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin had a last hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really, it&rsquo;s too childish! What are we doing? We ought to be in
      Paris, not here!... Just think!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on the point of opening the door and jumping out on the permanent
      way. But his companions held him back. The train started. He sat down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they continued their mad pursuit, travelling at random, toward the
      unknown...
    </p>
    <p>
      And this happened two days before the inevitable execution of Gilbert and
      Vaucheray.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. EXTRA-DRY?
    </h2>
    <p>
      On one of the hills that girdle Nice with the finest scenery in the world,
      between the Vallon de Saint-Silvestre and the Vallon de La Mantega, stands
      a huge hotel which overlooks the town and the wonderful Baie des Anges. A
      crowd flocks to it from all parts, forming a medley of every class and
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the same Saturday when Lupin, the Growler and the Masher
      were plunging into Italy, Clarisse Mergy entered this hotel, asked for a
      bedroom facing south and selected No. 130, on the second floor, a room
      which had been vacant since that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was separated from No. 129 by two partition-doors. As soon as she
      was alone, Clarisse pulled back the curtain that concealed the first door,
      noiselessly drew the bolt and put her ear to the second door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He is dressing to go to the club... as he did
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When her neighbour had gone, she went into the passage and, availing
      herself of a moment when there was no one in sight, walked up to the door
      of No. 129. The door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited all the evening for her neighbour&rsquo;s return and did not go to
      bed until two o&rsquo;clock. On Sunday morning, she resumed her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbour went out at eleven. This time he left the key in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly turning the key, Clarisse entered boldly, went to the
      partition-door, raised the curtain, drew the bolt and found herself in her
      own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, she heard two chambermaids doing the room in No. 129.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited until they were gone. Then, feeling sure that she would not be
      disturbed, she once more slipped into the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her excitement made her lean against a chair. After days and nights of
      stubborn pursuit, after alternate hopes and disappointments, she had at
      last succeeded in entering a room occupied by Daubrecq. She could look
      about at her ease; and, if she did not discover the crystal stopper, she
      could at least hide in the space between the partition-doors, behind the
      hanging, see Daubrecq, spy upon his movements and surprise his secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked around her. A travelling-bag at once caught her attention. She
      managed to open it; but her search was useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ransacked the trays of a trunk and the compartments of a portmanteau.
      She searched the wardrobe, the writing-table, the chest of drawers, the
      bathroom, all the tables, all the furniture. She found nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a start when she saw a scrap of paper on the balcony, lying as
      though flung there by accident:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be a trick of Daubrecq&rsquo;s?&rdquo; she thought, out loud. &ldquo;Can that scrap
      of paper contain...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said a voice behind her, as she put her hand on the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and saw Daubrecq.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt neither astonishment nor alarm, nor even any embarrassment at
      finding herself face to face with him. She had suffered too deeply for
      months to trouble about what Daubrecq could think of her or say, at
      catching her in the act of spying.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re out of it, dear friend. As the children say, you&rsquo;re not
      &lsquo;burning&rsquo; at all. Oh, not a bit of it! And it&rsquo;s so easy! Shall I help you?
      It&rsquo;s next to you, dear friend, on that little table... And yet, by Jove,
      there&rsquo;s not much on that little table! Something to read, something to
      write with, something to smoke, something to eat... and that&rsquo;s all... Will
      you have one of these candied fruits?... Or perhaps you would rather wait
      for the more substantial meal which I have ordered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse made no reply. She did not even seem to listen to what he was
      saying, as though she expected other words, more serious words, which he
      could not fail to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared the table of all the things that lay upon it and put them on
      the mantel-piece. Then he rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A head-waiter appeared. Daubrecq asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the lunch which I ordered ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for two, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the champagne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extra-dry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another waiter brought a tray and laid two covers on the table: a cold
      lunch, some fruit and a bottle of champagne in an ice-pail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two waiters withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, dear lady. As you see, I was thinking of you and your cover is
      laid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, without seeming to observe that Clarisse was not at all prepared to
      do honour to his invitation, he sat down, began to eat and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, upon my word, I hoped that you would end by consenting to this
      little private meeting. During the past week, while you were keeping so
      assiduous a watch upon me, I did nothing but say to myself, &lsquo;I wonder
      which she prefers: sweet champagne, dry champagne, or extra-dry?&rsquo; I was
      really puzzled. Especially after our departure from Paris. I had lost your
      tracks, that is to say, I feared that you had lost mine and abandoned the
      pursuit which was so gratifying to me. When I went for a walk, I missed
      your beautiful dark eyes, gleaming with hatred under your hair just
      touched with gray. But, this morning, I understood: the room next to mine
      was empty at last; and my friend Clarisse was able to take up her
      quarters, so to speak, by my bedside. From that moment I was reassured. I
      felt certain that, on coming back&mdash;instead of lunching in the
      restaurant as usual&mdash;I should find you arranging my things to your
      convenience and suiting your own taste. That was why I ordered two covers:
      one for your humble servant, the other for his fair friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was listening to him now and in the greatest terror. So Daubrecq knew
      that he was spied upon! For a whole week he had seen through her and all
      her schemes!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a low voice, anxious-eyed, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it on purpose, did you not? You only went away to drag me with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; retorted Daubrecq, laughing with
      a little cluck of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half-rose from her chair and, bending toward him, thought, as she
      thought each time, of the murder which she could commit, of the murder
      which she would commit. One revolver-shot and the odious brute was done
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly her hand glided to the weapon concealed in her bodice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One second, dear friend... You can shoot presently; but I beg you first
      to read this wire which I have just received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, not knowing what trap he was laying for her; but he went
      on, as he produced a telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert?&rdquo; she asked, greatly concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gilbert... Here, read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a yell of dismay. She had read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Execution on Tuesday morning.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And she at once flung herself on Daubrecq, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!... It&rsquo;s a lie... to madden me... Oh, I know you: you are
      capable of anything! Confess! It won&rsquo;t be on Tuesday, will it? In two
      days! No, no... I tell you, we have four days yet, five days, in which to
      save him... Confess it, confess it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no strength left, exhausted by this fit of rebellion; and her
      voice uttered none but inarticulate sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for a moment, then poured himself out a glass of
      champagne and drank it down at a gulp. He took a few steps up and down the
      room, came back to her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, darling...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The insult made her quiver with an unexpected energy. She drew herself up
      and, panting with indignation, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you... I forbid you to speak to me like that. I will not accept
      such an outrage. You wretch!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah, I see you&rsquo;re not quite alive to the position. That comes, of course,
      because you still hope for assistance in some quarter. Prasville, perhaps?
      The excellent Prasville, whose right hand you are... My dear friend, a
      forlorn hope... You must know that Prasville is mixed up in the Canal
      affair! Not directly: that is to say, his name is not on the list of the
      Twenty-seven; but it is there under the name of one of his friends, an
      ex-deputy called Vorenglade, Stanislas Vorenglade, his man of straw,
      apparently: a penniless individual whom I left alone and rightly. I knew
      nothing of all that until this morning, when, lo and behold, I received a
      letter informing me of the existence of a bundle of documents which prove
      the complicity of our one and only Prasville! And who is my informant?
      Vorenglade himself! Vorenglade, who, tired of living in poverty, wants to
      extort money from Prasville, at the risk of being arrested, and who will
      be delighted to come to terms with me. And Prasville will get the sack.
      Oh, what a lark! I swear to you that he will get the sack, the villain! By
      Jove, but he&rsquo;s annoyed me long enough! Prasville, old boy, you&rsquo;ve deserved
      it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands together, revelling in his coming revenge. And he
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear Clarisse... there&rsquo;s nothing to be done in that
      direction. What then? What straw will you cling to? Why, I was forgetting:
      M. Arsene Lupin! Mr. Growler! Mr. Masher!... Pah, you&rsquo;ll admit that those
      gentlemen have not shone and that all their feats of prowess have not
      prevented me from going my own little way. It was bound to be. Those
      fellows imagine that there&rsquo;s no one to equal them. When they meet an
      adversary like myself, one who is not to be bounced, it upsets them and
      they make blunder after blunder, while still believing that they are
      hoodwinking him like mad. Schoolboys, that&rsquo;s what they are! However, as
      you seem to have some illusions left about the aforesaid Lupin, as you are
      counting on that poor devil to crush me and to work a miracle in favour of
      your innocent Gilbert, come, let&rsquo;s dispel that illusion. Oh! Lupin! Lord
      above, she believes in Lupin! She places her last hopes in Lupin! Lupin!
      Just wait till I prick you, my illustrious windbag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up the receiver of the telephone which communicated with the hall
      of the hotel and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m No. 129, mademoiselle. Would you kindly ask the person sitting
      opposite your office to come up to me?... Huh!... Yes, mademoiselle, the
      gentleman in a gray felt hat. He knows. Thank you, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hanging up the receiver, he turned to Clarisse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. The man is discretion itself. Besides, it&rsquo;s the motto of
      his trade: &lsquo;Discretion and dispatch.&rsquo; As a retired detective, he has done
      me a number of services, including that of following you while you were
      following me. Since our arrival in the south, he has been less busy with
      you; but that was because he was more busy elsewhere. Come in, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He himself opened the door, and a short, thin man, with a red moustache,
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell this lady, Jacob, in a few brief words, what you have done
      since Wednesday evening, when, after letting her get into the
      train-de-luxe which was taking me from the Gare de Lyon to the south, you
      yourself remained on the platform at the station. Of course, I am not
      asking how you spent your time, except in so far as concerns the lady and
      the business with which I entrusted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacob dived into the inside-pocket of his jacket and produced a little
      note-book of which he turned over the pages and read them aloud in the
      voice of a man reading a report:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wednesday evening, 8.15. Gare de Lyon. Wait for two gents, Growler and
      Masher. They come with another whom I don&rsquo;t know yet, but who can only be
      M. Nicole. Give a porter ten francs for the loan of his cap and blouse.
      Accost the gents and tell them, from a lady, &lsquo;that they were gone to Monte
      Carlo.&rsquo; Next, telephone to the porter at the Hotel Franklin. All telegrams
      sent to his boss and dispatched by said boss will be read by said
      hotel-porter and, if necessary, intercepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thursday. Monte Carlo. The three gents search the hotels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday. Flying visits to La Turbie, the Cap d&rsquo;Ail, Cap Martin. M.
      Daubrecq rings me up. Thinks it wiser to send the gents to Italy. Make the
      porter of the Hotel Franklin send them a telegram appointing a meeting at
      San Remo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturday. San Remo. Station platform. Give the porter of the
      Ambassadeurs-Palace ten francs for the loan of his cap. The three gents
      arrive. They speak to me. Explain to them that a lady traveller, Mme.
      Mergy, is going on to Genoa, to the Hotel Continental. The gents hesitate.
      M. Nicole wants to get out. The others hold him back. The train starts.
      Good luck, gents! An hour later, I take the train for France and get out
      at Nice, to await fresh orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacob closed his note-book and concluded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. To-day&rsquo;s doings will be entered this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can enter them now, M. Jacob. &lsquo;12 noon. M. Daubrecq sends me to the
      Wagon-Lits Co. I book two berths in the Paris sleeping-car, by the 2.48
      train, and send them to M. Daubrecq by express messenger. Then I take the
      12.58 train for Vintimille, the frontier-station, where I spend the day on
      the platform watching all the travellers who come to France. Should
      Messrs. Nicole, Growler and Masher take it into their heads to leave Italy
      and return to Paris by way of Nice, my instructions are to telegraph to
      the headquarters of police that Master Arsene Lupin and two of his
      accomplices are in train number so-and-so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, Daubrecq led Jacob to the door. He closed it after him,
      turned the key, pushed the bolt and, going up to Clarisse, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, darling, listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time, she uttered no protest. What could she do against such an
      enemy, so powerful, so resourceful, who provided for everything, down to
      the minutest details, and who toyed with his adversaries in such an airy
      fashion? Even if she had hoped till then for Lupin&rsquo;s interference, how
      could she do so now, when he was wandering through Italy in pursuit of a
      shadow?
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood at last why three telegrams which she had sent to the Hotel
      Franklin had remained unanswered. Daubrecq was there, lurking in the dark,
      watching, establishing a void around her, separating her from her comrades
      in the fight, bringing her gradually, a beaten prisoner, within the four
      walls of that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt her weakness. She was at the monster&rsquo;s mercy. She must be silent
      and resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated, with an evil delight:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, darling. Listen to the irrevocable words which I am about
      to speak. Listen to them well. It is now 12 o&rsquo;clock. The last train starts
      at 2.48: you understand, the last train that can bring me to Paris
      to-morrow, Monday, in time to save your son. The evening-trains would
      arrive too late. The trains-de-luxe are full up. Therefore I shall have to
      start at 2.48. Am I to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our berths are booked. Will you come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my conditions for interfering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you accept them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, those horrible answers! The unhappy woman gave them in a sort of awful
      torpor, refusing even to understand what she was promising. Let him start
      first, let him snatch Gilbert from the engine of death whose vision
      haunted her day and night... And then... and then... let what must come
      come...
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst out laughing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you rogue, it&rsquo;s easily said!... You&rsquo;re ready to pledge yourself to
      anything, eh? The great thing is to save Gilbert, isn&rsquo;t it? Afterward,
      when that noodle of a Daubrecq comes with his engagement-ring, not a bit
      of it! Nothing doing! We&rsquo;ll laugh in his face!... No, no, enough of empty
      words. I don&rsquo;t want promises that won&rsquo;t be kept: I want facts, immediate
      facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came and sat close beside her and stated, plainly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I propose... what must be... what shall be... I will ask, or
      rather I will demand, not Gilbert&rsquo;s pardon, to begin with, but a reprieve,
      a postponement of the execution, a postponement of three or four weeks.
      They will invent a pretext of some sort: that&rsquo;s not my affair. And, when
      Mme. Mergy has become Mme. Daubrecq, then and not till then will I ask for
      his pardon, that is to say, the commutation of his sentence. And make
      yourself quite easy: they&rsquo;ll grant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept... I accept,&rdquo; she stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed once more:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you accept, because that will happen in a month&rsquo;s time... and
      meanwhile you reckon on finding some trick, an assistance of some kind or
      another... M. Arsene Lupin...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it on the head of my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The head of your son!... Why, my poor pet, you would sell yourself to the
      devil to save it from falling!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she whispered, shuddering. &ldquo;I would gladly sell my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sidled up against her and, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clarisse, it&rsquo;s not your soul I ask for... It&rsquo;s something else... For more
      than twenty years my life has spun around that longing. You are the only
      woman I have ever loved... Loathe me, hate me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;but
      do not spurn me... Am I to wait? To wait another month?... No, Clarisse, I
      have waited too many years already...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ventured to touch her hand. Clarisse shrank back with such disgust that
      he was seized with fury and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I swear to heaven, my beauty, the executioner won&rsquo;t stand on such
      ceremony when he catches hold of your son!... And you give yourself airs!
      Why, think, it&rsquo;ll happen in forty hours! Forty hours, no more, and you
      hesitate... and you have scruples, when your son&rsquo;s life is at stake! Come,
      come, no whimpering, no silly sentimentality... Look things in the face.
      By your own oath, you are my wife, you are my bride from this moment...
      Clarisse, Clarisse, give me your lips...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-fainting, she had hardly the strength to put out her arm and push him
      away; and, with a cynicism in which all his abominable nature stood
      revealed, Daubrecq, mingling words of cruelty and words of passion,
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save your son!... Think of the last morning: the preparations for the
      scaffold, when they snip away his shirt and cut his hair... Clarisse,
      Clarisse, I will save him... Be sure of it... All my life shall be yours
      ... Clarisse...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She no longer resisted. It was over. The loathsome brute&rsquo;s lips were about
      to touch hers; and it had to be, and nothing could prevent it. It was her
      duty to obey the decree of fate. She had long known it. She understood it;
      and, closing her eyes, so as not to see the foul face that was slowly
      raised to hers, she repeated to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son... my poor son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds passed: ten, twenty perhaps. Daubrecq did not move. Daubrecq
      did not speak. And she was astounded at that great silence and that sudden
      quiet. Did the monster, at the last moment, feel a scruple of remorse?
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight which she beheld struck her with stupefaction. Instead of the
      grinning features which she expected to see, she saw a motionless,
      unrecognizable face, contorted by an expression of unspeakable terror: and
      the eyes, invisible under the double impediment of the spectacles, seemed
      to be staring above her head, above the chair in which she lay prostrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse turned her face. Two revolver-barrels, pointed at Daubrecq,
      showed on the right, a little above the chair. She saw only that: those
      two huge, formidable revolvers, gripped in two clenched hands. She saw
      only that and also Daubrecq&rsquo;s face, which fear was discolouring little by
      little, until it turned livid. And, almost at the same time, some one
      slipped behind Daubrecq, sprang up fiercely, flung one of his arms round
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s neck, threw him to the ground with incredible violence and
      applied a pad of cotton-wool to his face. A sudden smell of chloroform
      filled the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse had recognized M. Nicole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Growler!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come along, Masher! Drop your shooters:
      I&rsquo;ve got him! He&rsquo;s a limp rag... Tie him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq, in fact, was bending in two and falling on his knees like a
      disjointed doll. Under the action of the chloroform, the fearsome brute
      sank into impotence, became harmless and grotesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Growler and the Masher rolled him in one of the blankets of the bed
      and tied him up securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; shouted Lupin, leaping to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in a sudden reaction of mad delight, he began to dance a wild jig in
      the middle of the room, a jig mingled with bits of can-can and the
      contortions of the cakewalk and the whirls of a dancing dervish and the
      acrobatic movements of a clown and the lurching steps of a drunken man.
      And he announced, as though they were the numbers in a music-hall
      performance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner&rsquo;s dance!... The captive&rsquo;s hornpipe!... A fantasia on the
      corpse of a representative of the people!... The chloroform polka!... The
      two-step of the conquered goggles! Olle! Olle! The blackmailer&rsquo;s fandango!
      Hoot! Hoot! The McDaubrecq&rsquo;s fling!... The turkey trot!... And the bunny
      hug!... And the grizzly bear!... The Tyrolean dance: tra-la-liety!...
      Allons, enfants de la partie!... Zing, boum, boum! Zing, boum, boum!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All his street-arab nature, all his instincts of gaiety, so long
      suppressed by his constant anxiety and disappointment, came out and
      betrayed themselves in roars of laughter, bursts of animal spirits and a
      picturesque need of childlike exuberance and riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a last high kick, turned a series of cartwheels round the room and
      ended by standing with his hands on his hips and one foot on Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      lifeless body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An allegorical tableau!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The angel of virtue destroying
      the hydra of vice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the humour of the scene was twice as great because Lupin was appearing
      under the aspect of M. Nicole, in the clothes and figure of that wizened,
      awkward, nervous private tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sad smile flickered across Mme. Mergy&rsquo;s face, her first smile for many a
      long month. But, at once returning to the reality of things, she besought
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please... think of Gilbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran up to her, caught her in his arms and, obeying a spontaneous
      impulse, so frank that she could but laugh at it, gave her a resounding
      kiss on either cheek:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, lady, that&rsquo;s the kiss of a decent man! Instead of Daubrecq, it&rsquo;s I
      kissing you... Another word and I&rsquo;ll do it again... and I&rsquo;ll call you
      darling next... Be angry with me, if you dare. Oh, how happy I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt before her on one knee. And, respectfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame. The fit is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, getting up again, resuming his whimsical manner, he continued, while
      Clarisse wondered what he was driving at:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the next article, madame? Your son&rsquo;s pardon, perhaps? Certainly!
      Madame, I have the honour to grant you the pardon of your son, the
      commutation of his sentence to penal servitude for life and, to wind up
      with, his early escape. It&rsquo;s settled, eh, Growler? Settled, Masher, what?
      You&rsquo;ll both go with the boy to New Caledonia and arrange for everything.
      Oh, my dear Daubrecq, we owe you a great debt! But I&rsquo;m not forgetting you,
      believe me! What would you like? A last pipe? Coming, coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took one of the pipes from the mantel-piece, stooped over the prisoner,
      shifted his pad and thrust the amber mouth-piece between his teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw, old chap, draw. Lord, how funny you look, with your plug over your
      nose and your cutty in your mouth. Come, puff away. By Jove, I forgot to
      fill your pipe! Where&rsquo;s your tobacco, your favourite Maryland? ... Oh,
      here we are!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took from the chimney an unopened yellow packet and tore off the
      government band:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship&rsquo;s tobacco! Ladies and gentlemen, keep your eyes on me! This
      is a great moment. I am about to fill his lordship&rsquo;s pipe: by Jupiter,
      what an honour! Observe my movements! You see, I have nothing in my hands,
      nothing up my sleeves!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back his cuffs and stuck out his elbows. Then he opened the
      packet and inserted his thumb and fore-finger, slowly, gingerly, like a
      conjurer performing a sleight-of-hand trick before a puzzled audience,
      and, beaming all over his face, extracted from the tobacco a glittering
      object which he held out before the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the crystal stopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rushed at Lupin and snatched it from him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it; that&rsquo;s the one!&rdquo; she exclaimed, feverishly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
      scratch on the stem! And look at this line running down the middle, where
      the gilt finishes... That&rsquo;s it; it unscrews!... Oh, dear, my strength&rsquo;s
      going!...&rdquo; She trembled so violently that Lupin took back the stopper and
      unscrewed it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside of the knob was hollow; and in the hollow space was a piece of
      paper rolled into a tiny pellet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foreign-post-paper,&rdquo; he whispered, himself greatly excited, with
      quivering hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. All four felt as if their hearts were ready to
      burst from their bodies; and they were afraid of what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please...&rdquo; stammered Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin unfolded the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a set of names written one below the other, twenty-seven of
      them, the twenty-seven names of the famous list: Langeroux, Dechaumont,
      Vorenglade, d&rsquo;Albufex, Victorien Mergy and the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, at the foot, the signature of the chairman of the Two-Seas Canal
      Company, the signature written in letters of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin looked at his watch:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter to one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have twenty minutes to spare. Let&rsquo;s have
      some lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Clarisse, who was already beginning to lose her head, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      forget...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He simply said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know is that I&rsquo;m dying of hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at the table, cut himself a large slice of cold pie and said
      to his accomplices:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Growler? A bite? You, Masher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do with a mouthful, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hurry up, lads. And a glass of champage to wash it down with: it&rsquo;s
      the chloroform-patient&rsquo;s treat. Your health, Daubrecq! Sweet champagne?
      Dry champagne? Extra-dry?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE CROSS OF LORRAINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moment Lupin had finished lunch, he at once and, so to speak, without
      transition, recovered all his mastery and authority. The time for joking
      was past; and he must no longer yield to his love of astonishing people
      with claptrap and conjuring tricks. Now that he had discovered the crystal
      stopper in the hiding-place which he had guessed with absolute certainty,
      now that he possessed the list of the Twenty-seven, it became a question
      of playing off the last game of the rubber without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was child&rsquo;s play, no doubt, and what remained to be done presented no
      difficulty. Nevertheless, it was essential that he should perform these
      final actions with promptness, decision and infallible perspicacity. The
      smallest blunder was irretrievable. Lupin knew this; but his strangely
      lucid brain had allowed for every contingency. And the movements and words
      which he was now about to make and utter were all fully prepared and
      matured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Growler, the commissionaire is waiting on the Boulevard Gambetta with his
      barrow and the trunk which we bought. Bring him here and have the trunk
      carried up. If the people of the hotel ask any questions, say it&rsquo;s for the
      lady in No. 130.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing his other companion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masher, go back to the station and take over the limousine. The price is
      arranged: ten thousand francs. Buy a chauffeur&rsquo;s cap and overcoat and
      bring the car to the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin opened a pocketbook which had been removed from Daubrecq&rsquo;s jacket
      and produced a huge bundle of bank-notes. He separated ten of them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are. Our friend appears to have been doing well at the club. Off
      with you, Masher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men went out through Clarisse&rsquo;s room. Lupin availed himself of a
      moment when Clarisse Mergy was not looking to stow away the pocketbook
      with the greatest satisfaction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have done a fair stroke of business,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;When
      all the expenses are paid, I shall still be well to the good; and it&rsquo;s not
      over yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to Clarisse Mergy, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I bought one when I reached Nice, with some linen and a few
      necessaries; for I left Paris unprepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get all that ready. Then go down to the office. Say that you are
      expecting a trunk which a commissionaire is bringing from the station
      cloakroom and that you will want to unpack and pack it again in your room;
      and tell them that you are leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When alone, Lupin examined Daubrecq carefully, felt in all his pockets and
      appropriated everything that seemed to present any sort of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Growler was the first to return. The trunk, a large wicker hamper
      covered with black moleskin, was taken into Clarisse&rsquo;s room. Assisted by
      Clarisse and the Growler, Lupin moved Daubrecq and put him in the trunk,
      in a sitting posture, but with his head bent so as to allow of the lid
      being fastened:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s as comfortable as your berth in a sleeping-car, my
      dear deputy,&rdquo; Lupin observed. &ldquo;But, all the same, it&rsquo;s better than a
      coffin. At least, you can breathe. Three little holes in each side. You
      have nothing to complain of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, unstopping a flask:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drop more chloroform? You seem to love it!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He soaked the pad once more, while, by his orders, Clarisse and the
      Growler propped up the deputy with linen, rugs and pillows, which they had
      taken the precaution to heap in the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;That trunk is fit to go round the world. Lock it
      and strap it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Masher arrived, in a chauffeur&rsquo;s livery:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The car&rsquo;s below, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take the trunk down between you. It would be dangerous
      to give it to the hotel-servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if any one meets us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then, Masher? Aren&rsquo;t you a chauffeur? You&rsquo;re carrying the
      trunk of your employer here present, the lady in No. 130, who will also go
      down, step into her motor... and wait for me two hundred yards farther on.
      Growler, you help to hoist the trunk up. Oh, first lock the
      partition-door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin went to the next room, closed the other door, shot the bolt, walked
      out, locked the door behind him and went down in the lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the office, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Daubrecq has suddenly been called away to Monte Carlo. He asked me to
      say that he would not be back until Tuesday and that you were to keep his
      room for him. His things are all there. Here is the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked away quietly and went after the car, where he found Clarisse
      lamenting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never be in Paris to-morrow! It&rsquo;s madness! The least
      breakdown...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you and I are going to take the train. It&rsquo;s safer...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put her into a cab and gave his parting instructions to the two men:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty miles an hour, on the average, do you understand? You&rsquo;re to drive
      and rest, turn and turn about. At that rate, you ought to be in Paris
      between six and seven to-morrow evening. But don&rsquo;t force the pace. I&rsquo;m
      keeping Daubrecq, not because I want him for my plans, but as a hostage...
      and then by way of precaution... I like to feel that I can lay my hands on
      him during the next few days. So look after the dear fellow... Give him a
      few drops of chloroform every three or four hours: it&rsquo;s his one
      weakness... Off with you, Masher... And you, Daubrecq, don&rsquo;t get excited
      up there. The roof&rsquo;ll bear you all right... If you feel at all sick, don&rsquo;t
      mind... Off you go, Masher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched the car move into the distance and then told the cabman to
      drive to a post-office, where he dispatched a telegram in these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;M. Prasville, Prefecture de Police, Paris:

 &ldquo;Person found.  Will bring you document eleven o&rsquo;clock
 to-morrow morning.  Urgent communication.

        &ldquo;CLARISSE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Clarisse and Lupin reached the station by half-past two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only there&rsquo;s room!&rdquo; said Clarisse, who was alarmed at the least thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Room? Why, our berths are booked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jacob... by Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at the office of the hotel they gave me a letter which had come for
      Daubrecq by express. It was the two berths which Jacob had sent him. Also,
      I have his deputy&rsquo;s pass. So we shall travel under the name of M. and Mme.
      Daubrecq and we shall receive all the attention due to our rank and
      station. You see, my dear madam, that everything&rsquo;s arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The journey, this time, seemed short to Lupin. Clarisse told him what she
      had done during the past few days. He himself explained the miracle of his
      sudden appearance in Daubrecq&rsquo;s bedroom at the moment when his adversary
      believed him in Italy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A miracle, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But still a remarkable phenomenon took place in
      me when I left San Remo, a sort of mysterious intuition which prompted me
      first to try and jump out of the train&mdash;and the Masher prevented me&mdash;and
      next to rush to the window, let down the glass and follow the porter of
      the Ambassadeurs-Palace, who had given me your message, with my eyes.
      Well, at that very minute, the porter aforesaid was rubbing his hands with
      an air of such satisfaction that, for no other reason, suddenly, I
      understood everything: I had been diddled, taken in by Daubrecq, as you
      yourself were. Heaps of little details flashed across my mind. My
      adversary&rsquo;s scheme became clear to me from start to finish. Another
      minute... and the disaster would have been beyond remedy. I had, I
      confess, a few moments of real despair, at the thought that I should not
      be able to repair all the mistakes that had been made. It depended simply
      on the time-table of the trains, which would either allow me or would not
      allow me to find Daubrecq&rsquo;s emissary on the railway-platform at San Remo.
      This time, at last, chance favoured me. We had hardly alighted at the
      first station when a train passed, for France. When we arrived at San
      Remo, the man was there. I had guessed right. He no longer wore his
      hotel-porter&rsquo;s cap and frock-coat, but a jacket and bowler. He stepped
      into a second-class compartment. From that moment, victory was assured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But... how...?&rdquo; asked Clarisse, who, in spite of the thoughts that
      obsessed her, was interested in Lupin&rsquo;s story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I find you? Lord, simply by not losing sight of Master Jacob,
      while leaving him free to move about as he pleased, knowing that he was
      bound to account for his actions to Daubrecq. In point of fact, this
      morning, after spending the night in a small hotel at Nice, he met
      Daubrecq on the Promenade des Anglais. They talked for some time. I
      followed them. Daubrecq went back to the hotel, planted Jacob in one of
      the passages on the ground-floor, opposite the telephone-office, and went
      up in the lift. Ten minutes later I knew the number of his room and knew
      that a lady had been occupying the next room, No. 130, since the day
      before. &lsquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve done it,&rsquo; I said to the Growler and the Masher. I
      tapped lightly at your door. No answer. And the door was locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we opened it. Do you think there&rsquo;s only one key in the world that
      will work a lock? So I walked in. Nobody in your room. But the
      partition-door was ajar. I slipped through it. Thenceforth, a mere hanging
      separated me from you, from Daubrecq and from the packet of tobacco which
      I saw on the chimney-slab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew the hiding-place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A look round Daubrecq&rsquo;s study in Paris showed me that that packet of
      tobacco had disappeared. Besides...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew, from certain confessions wrung from Daubrecq in the Lovers&rsquo; 
      Tower, that the word Marie held the key to the riddle. Since then I had
      certainly thought of this word, but with the preconceived notion that it
      was spelt M A R I E. Well, it was really the first two syllables of
      another word, which I guessed, so to speak, only at the moment when I was
      struck by the absence of the packet of tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What word do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maryland, Maryland tobacco, the only tobacco that Daubrecq smokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lupin began to laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it silly? And, at the same time, wasn&rsquo;t it clever of Daubrecq? We
      looked everywhere, we ransacked everything. Didn&rsquo;t I unscrew the brass
      sockets of the electric lights to see if they contained a crystal stopper?
      But how could I have thought, how could any one, however great his
      perspicacity, have thought of tearing off the paper band of a packet of
      Maryland, a band put on, gummed, sealed, stamped and dated by the State,
      under the control of the Inland Revenue Office? Only think! The State the
      accomplice of such an act of infamy! The Inland R-r-r-revenue Awfice
      lending itself to such a trick! No, a thousand times no! The Regie [*] is
      not perfect. It makes matches that won&rsquo;t light and cigarettes filled with
      hay. But there&rsquo;s all the difference in the world between recognizing that
      fact and believing the Inland Revenue to be in league with Daubrecq with
      the object of hiding the list of the Twenty-seven from the legitimate
      curiosity of the government and the enterprising efforts of Arsene Lupin!
      Observe that all Daubrecq had to do, in order to introduce the crystal
      stopper, was to bear upon the band a little, loosen it, draw it back,
      unfold the yellow paper, remove the tobacco and fasten it up again.
      Observe also that all we had to do, in Paris, was to take the packet in
      our hands and examine it, in order to discover the hiding-place. No
      matter! The packet itself, the plug of Maryland made up and passed by the
      State and by the Inland Revenue Office, was a sacred, intangible thing, a
      thing above suspicion! And nobody opened it. That was how that demon of a
      Daubrecq allowed that untouched packet of tobacco to lie about for months
      on his table, among his pipes and among other unopened packets of tobacco.
      And no power on earth could have given any one even the vaguest notion of
      looking into that harmless little cube. I would have you observe,
      besides...&rdquo; Lupin went on pursuing his remarks relative to the packet of
      Maryland and the crystal stopper. His adversary&rsquo;s ingenuity and shrewdness
      interested him all the more inasmuch as Lupin had ended by getting the
      better of him. But to Clarisse these topics mattered much less than did
      her anxiety as to the acts which must be performed to save her son; and
      she sat wrapped in her own thoughts and hardly listened to him.

      &ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; she kept on repeating, &ldquo;that you will succeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Prasville is not in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s not there, he&rsquo;s at the Havre. I saw it in the paper yesterday. In
      any case, a telegram will bring him to Paris at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think that he has enough influence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To obtain the pardon of Vaucheray and Gilbert personally. No. If he had,
      we should have set him to work before now. But he is intelligent enough to
      understand the value of what we are bringing him and to act without a
      moment&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, to be accurate, are you not deceived as to that value?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Daubrecq deceived? Was Daubrecq not in a better position than any of
      us to know the full power of that paper? Did he not have twenty proofs of
      it, each more convincing than the last? Think of all that he was able to
      do, for the sole reason that people knew him to possess the list. They
      knew it; and that was all. He did not use the list, but he had it. And,
      having it, he killed your husband. He built up his fortune on the ruin and
      the disgrace of the Twenty-seven. Only last week, one of the gamest of the
      lot, d&rsquo;Albufex, cut his throat in a prison. No, take it from me, as the
      price of handing over that list, we could ask for anything we pleased. And
      we are asking for what? Almost nothing ... less than nothing... the pardon
      of a child of twenty. In other words, they will take us for idiots. What!
      We have in our hands...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. Clarisse, exhausted by so much excitement, sat fast asleep in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Paris at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin found two telegrams awaiting him at his flat in the Place de Clichy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was from the Masher, dispatched from Avignon on the previous day and
      stating that all was going well and that they hoped to keep their
      appointment punctually that evening. The other was from Prasville, dated
      from the Havre and addressed to Clarisse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Impossible return to-morrow Monday morning.  Come to my office
 five o&rsquo;clock.  Reckon on you absolutely.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; said Clarisse. &ldquo;How late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a first-rate hour,&rdquo; declared Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, if...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the execution is to take place to-morrow morning: is that what you
      mean to say?... Don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak out, for the execution will not
      take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t read the newspapers and you are not to read them. Nothing
      that they can say matters in the least. One thing alone matters: our
      interview with Prasville. Besides...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a little bottle from a cupboard and, putting his hand on
      Clarisse&rsquo;s shoulder, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down here, on the sofa, and take a few drops of this mixture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make you sleep for a few hours... and forget. That&rsquo;s always so
      much gained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Clarisse, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to. Gilbert is not asleep. He
      is not forgetting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; said Lupin, with gentle insistence. She yielded all of a
      sudden, from cowardice, from excessive suffering, and did as she was told
      and lay on the sofa and closed her eyes. In a few minutes she was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin rang for his servant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers... quick!... Have you bought them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin opened one of them and at once read the following lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;ARSENE LUPIN&rsquo;S ACCOMPLICES&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;We know from a positive source that Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s
  accomplices, Gilbert and Vaucheray, will be executed
  to-morrow, Tuesday, morning. M. Deibler has inspected
  the scaffold.  Everything is ready.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He raised his head with a defiant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s accomplices! The execution of Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s accomplices!
      What a fine spectacle! And what a crowd there will be to witness it!
      Sorry, gentlemen, but the curtain will not rise. Theatre closed by order
      of the authorities. And the authorities are myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck his chest violently, with an arrogant gesture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The authorities are myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock Lupin received a telegram which the Masher had sent from
      Lyons:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well. Goods will arrive without damage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock Clarisse woke. Her first words were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to be to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. But she saw him look so calm and smiling that she felt
      herself permeated with an immense sense of peace and received the
      impression that everything was finished, disentangled, settled according
      to her companion&rsquo;s will.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the house at ten minutes past four. Prasville&rsquo;s secretary, who
      had received his chief&rsquo;s instructions by telephone, showed them into the
      office and asked them to wait. It was a quarter to five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville came running in at five o&rsquo;clock exactly and, at once, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand. Clarisse, who had risen from her chair, did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville looked at her for a moment, hesitated and sat down. He
      understood. In pursuing Daubrecq, Clarisse Mergy had not acted only from
      hatred and the desire for revenge. Another motive prompted her. The paper
      would not be handed over except upon conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, please,&rdquo; he said, thus showing that he accepted the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse resumed her seat and, when she remained silent, Prasville said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, my friend, and speak quite frankly. I do not scruple to say that
      we wish to have that paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is only a wish,&rdquo; remarked Clarisse, whom Lupin had coached in her
      part down to the least detail, &ldquo;if it is only a wish, I fear that we shall
      not be able to come to an arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville smiled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wish, obviously, would lead us to make certain sacrifices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every sacrifice,&rdquo; said Mme. Mergy, correcting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every sacrifice, provided, of course, that we keep within the bounds of
      acceptable requirements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even if we go beyond those bounds,&rdquo; said Clarisse, inflexibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville began to lose patience:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, what is it all about? Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my friend, but I wanted above all to mark the great
      importance which you attach to that paper and, in view of the immediate
      transaction which we are about to conclude, to specify&mdash;what shall I
      say?&mdash;the value of my share in it. That value, which has no limits,
      must, I repeat, be exchanged for an unlimited value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Prasville, querulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume, therefore, that it is unnecessary for me to trace the whole
      story of the business or to enumerate, on the one hand, the disasters
      which the possession of that paper would have allowed you to avert and, on
      the other hand, the incalculable advantages which you will be able to
      derive from its possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville had to make an effort to contain himself and to answer in a tone
      that was civil, or nearly so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit everything. Is that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but we cannot explain ourselves too plainly. And there
      is one point that remains to be cleared up. Are you in a position to
      treat, personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know not, of course, if you are empowered to settle this
      business here and now, but if, in dealing with me, you represent the views
      of those who know the business and who are qualified to settle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; declared Prasville, forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I can have your answer within an hour after I have told you my
      conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the answer be that of the government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse bent forward and, sinking her voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the answer be that of the Elysee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville appeared surprised. He reflected for a moment and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only remains for me to ask you to give me your word of honour that,
      however incomprehensible my conditions may appear to you, you will not
      insist on my revealing the reason. They are what they are. Your answer
      must be yes or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honour,&rdquo; said Prasville, formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse underwent a momentary agitation that made her turn paler still.
      Then, mastering herself, with her eyes fixed on Prasville&rsquo;s eyes, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have the list of the Twenty-seven in exchange for the pardon of
      Gilbert and Vaucheray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville leapt from his chair, looking absolutely dumbfounded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pardon of Gilbert and Vaucheray? Of Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s accomplices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The murderers of the Villa Marie-Therese? The two who are due to die
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, those two,&rdquo; she said, in a loud voice. &ldquo;I ask? I demand their
      pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is madness! Why? Why should you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must remind you, Prasville, that you gave me your word...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... yes... I know... But the thing is so unexpected...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? For all sorts of reasons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well... well, but... think! Gilbert and Vaucheray have been sentenced to
      death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send them to penal servitude: that&rsquo;s all you have to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! The case has created an enormous sensation. They are Arsene
      Lupin&rsquo;s accomplices. The whole world knows about the verdict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we cannot, no, we cannot go against the decrees of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not asked to do that. You are asked for a commutation of
      punishment as an act of mercy. Mercy is a legal thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pardoning-commission has given its finding...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but there remains the president of the Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can reconsider his refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no excuse for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs no excuse. The right of mercy is absolute. It is exercised
      without control, without reason, without excuse or explanation. It is a
      royal prerogative; the president of the Republic can wield it according to
      his good pleasure, or rather according to his conscience, in the best
      interests of the State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is too late! Everything is ready. The execution is to take place
      in a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hour is long enough to obtain your answer; you have just told us so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is confounded madness! There are insuperable obstacles to your
      conditions. I tell you again, it&rsquo;s impossible, physically impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the answer is no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! A thousand times no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, there is nothing left for us to do but to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved toward the door. M. Nicole followed her. Prasville bounded
      across the room and barred their way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friend, it seems to me that our conversation is at an end. As
      you appear to think, as, in fact, you are certain that the president of
      the Republic will not consider the famous list of the Twenty-seven to be
      worth...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; said Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the key in the door and began to pace the room, with his hands
      behind his back and his eyes fixed on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lupin, who had not breathed a word during the whole of this scene and
      who had prudently contented himself with playing a colourless part, said
      to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fuss! What a lot of affectation to arrive at the inevitable
      result! As though Prasville, who is not a genius, but not an absolute
      blockhead either, would be likely to lose the chance of revenging himself
      on his mortal enemy! There, what did I say? The idea of hurling Daubrecq
      into the bottomless pit appeals to him. Come, we&rsquo;ve won the rubber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville was opening a small inner door which led to the office of his
      private secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave an order aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Lartigue, telephone to the Elysee and say that I request the favour of
      an audience for a communication of the utmost importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door, came back to Clarisse and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, my intervention is limited to submitting your proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once you submit it, it will be accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed. Clarisse&rsquo;s features expressed so profound a
      delight that Prasville was struck by it and looked at her with attentive
      curiosity. For what mysterious reason did Clarisse wish to save Gilbert
      and Vaucheray? What was the incomprehensible link that bound her to those
      two men? What tragedy connected those three lives and, no doubt,
      Daubrecq&rsquo;s in addition?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, old boy,&rdquo; thought Lupin, &ldquo;cudgel your brains: you&rsquo;ll never spot
      it! Ah, if we had asked for Gilbert&rsquo;s pardon only, as Clarisse wished, you
      might have twigged the secret! But Vaucheray, that brute of a Vaucheray,
      there really could not be the least bond between Mme. Mergy and him....
      Aha, by Jingo, it&rsquo;s my turn now!... He&rsquo;s watching me ... The inward
      soliloquy is turning upon myself... &lsquo;I wonder who that M. Nicole can be?
      Why has that little provincial usher devoted himself body and soul to
      Clarisse Mergy? Who is that old bore, if the truth were known? I made a
      mistake in not inquiring... I must look into this.... I must rip off the
      beggar&rsquo;s mask. For, after all, it&rsquo;s not natural that a man should take so
      much trouble about a matter in which he is not directly interested. Why
      should he also wish to save Gilbert and Vaucheray? Why? Why should he?...&rdquo;
       Lupin turned his head away. &ldquo;Look out!... Look out!... There&rsquo;s a notion
      passing through that red-tape-merchant&rsquo;s skull: a confused notion which he
      can&rsquo;t put into words. Hang it all, he mustn&rsquo;t suspect M. Lupin under M.
      Nicole! The thing&rsquo;s complicated enough as it is, in all conscience!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was a welcome interruption. Prasville&rsquo;s secretary came to say
      that the audience would take place in an hour&rsquo;s time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Thank you,&rdquo; said Prasville. &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, resuming the interview, with no further circumlocution, speaking like
      a man who means to put a thing through, he declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we shall be able to manage it. But, first of all, so that I
      may do what I have undertaken to do, I want more precise information,
      fuller details. Where was the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the crystal stopper, as we thought,&rdquo; said Mme. Mergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where was the crystal stopper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an object which Daubrecq came and fetched, a few days ago, from the
      writing-desk in his study in the Square Lamartine, an object which I took
      from him yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply a packet of tobacco, Maryland tobacco, which used to lie about on
      the desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville was petrified. He muttered, guilelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if I had only known! I&rsquo;ve had my hand on that packet of Maryland a
      dozen times! How stupid of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; said Clarisse. &ldquo;The great thing is that the
      discovery is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville pulled a face which implied that the discovery would have been
      much pleasanter if he himself had made it. Then he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have the list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when Clarisse hesitated, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, don&rsquo;t be afraid! The list belongs to you, and I will give it
      back to you. But you must understand that I cannot take the step in
      question without making certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse consulted M. Nicole with a glance which did not escape Prasville.
      Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized the scrap of paper with a certain excitement, examined it and
      almost immediately said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes... the secretary&rsquo;s writing: I recognize it.... And the signature
      of the chairman of the company: the signature in red.... Besides, I have
      other proofs.... For instance, the torn piece which completes the
      left-hand top corner of this sheet...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his safe and, from a special cash-box, produced a tiny piece of
      paper which he put against the top left corner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The torn edges fit exactly. The proof is undeniable. All
      that remains is to verify the make of this foreign-post-paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse was radiant with delight. No one would have believed that the
      most terrible torture had racked her for weeks and weeks and that she was
      still bleeding and quivering from its effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Prasville was holding the paper against a window-pane, she said to
      Lupin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon having Gilbert informed this evening. He must be so awfully
      unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Besides, you can go to his lawyer and tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I must see Gilbert to-morrow. Prasville can think what he
      likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But he must first gain his cause at the Elysee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any difficulty, can there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You saw that he gave way at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville continued his examination with the aid of a magnifying-glass and
      compared the sheet with the scrap of torn paper. Next, he took from the
      cash-box some other sheets of letter-paper and examined one of these by
      holding it up to the light:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mind is made up. Forgive me, dear friend: it
      was a very difficult piece of work.... I passed through various stages.
      When all is said, I had my suspicions... and not without cause...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One second.... I must give an order first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called his secretary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please telephone at once to the Elysee, make my apologies and say that I
      shall not require the audience, for reasons which I will explain later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door and returned to his desk. Clarisse and Lupin stood
      choking, looking at him in stupefaction, failing to understand this sudden
      change. Was he mad? Was it a trick on his part? A breach of faith? And was
      he refusing to keep his promise, now that he possessed the list?
    </p>
    <p>
      He held it out to Clarisse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have it back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And return it to Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Daubrecq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you prefer to burn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that, if I were in your place, I would burn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that? It&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, it is very sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? I will tell you. The list of the Twenty-seven, as we know for
      absolutely certain, was written on a sheet of letter-paper belonging to
      the chairman of the Canal Company, of which there are a few samples in
      this cash-box. Now all these samples have as a water-mark a little cross
      of Lorraine which is almost invisible, but which can just be seen in the
      thickness of the paper when you hold it up to the light. The sheet which
      you have brought me does not contain that little cross of Lorraine.&rdquo; [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Cross of Lorraine is a cross with two horizontal lines
     or bars across the upper half of the perpendicular beam.
     &mdash;Translator&rsquo;s Note.

    <p>
      Lupin felt a nervous trembling shake him from head to foot and he dared
      not turn his eyes on Clarisse, realizing what a terrible blow this was to
      her. He heard her stammer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then are we to suppose... that Daubrecq was taken in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; exclaimed Prasville. &ldquo;It is you who have been taken in,
      my poor friend. Daubrecq has the real list, the list which he stole from
      the dying man&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this one...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one is a forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forgery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An undoubted forgery. It was an admirable piece of cunning on Daubrecq&rsquo;s
      part. Dazzled by the crystal stopper which he flashed before your eyes,
      you did nothing but look for that stopper in which he had stowed away no
      matter what, the first bit of paper that came to hand, while he quietly
      kept...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville interrupted himself. Clarisse was walking up to him with short,
      stiff steps, like an automaton. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what, dear friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I am obliged to; I have no choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to take that step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, how can I do what you ask? It&rsquo;s not possible, on the strength
      of a valueless document...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do it?... You won&rsquo;t do it?... And, to-morrow morning... in a
      few hours... Gilbert...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was frightfully pale, her face sunk, like the face of one dying. Her
      eyes opened wider and wider and her teeth chattered...
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin, fearing the useless and dangerous words which she was about to
      utter, seized her by the shoulders and tried to drag her away. But she
      thrust him back with indomitable strength, took two or three more steps,
      staggered, as though on the point of falling, and, suddenly, in a burst of
      energy and despair, laid hold of Prasville and screamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall go to the Elysee!... You shall go at once!... You must!... You
      must save Gilbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please, my dear friend, calm yourself...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a strident laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm myself!... When, to-morrow morning, Gilbert... Ah, no, no, I am
      terrified... it&rsquo;s appalling.... Oh, run, you wretch, run! Obtain his
      pardon!... Don&rsquo;t you understand? Gilbert... Gilbert is my son! My son! My
      son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville gave a cry. The blade of a knife flashed in Clarisse&rsquo;s hand and
      she raised her arm to strike herself. But the movement was not completed.
      M. Nicole caught her arm in its descent and, taking the knife from
      Clarisse, reducing her to helplessness, he said, in a voice that rang
      through the room like steel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you are doing is madness!... When I gave you my oath that I would
      save him! You must... live for him... Gilbert shall not die.... How can he
      die, when... I gave you my oath?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert... my son...&rdquo; moaned Clarisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clasped her fiercely, drew her against himself and put his hand over
      her mouth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! Be quiet!... I entreat you to be quiet.... Gilbert shall not
      die...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With irresistible authority, he dragged her away like a subdued child that
      suddenly becomes obedient; but, at the moment of opening the door, he
      turned to Prasville:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for me here, monsieur,&rdquo; he commanded, in an imperative tone. &ldquo;If you
      care about that list of the Twenty-seven, the real list, wait for me. I
      shall be back in an hour, in two hours, at most; and then we will talk
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And abruptly, to Clarisse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, madame, a little courage yet. I command you to show courage, in
      Gilbert&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away, through the passages, down the stairs, with a jerky step,
      holding Clarisse under the arm, as he might have held a lay-figure,
      supporting her, carrying her almost. A court-yard, another court-yard,
      then the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Prasville, surprised at first, bewildered by the course of
      events, was gradually recovering his composure and thinking. He thought of
      that M. Nicole, a mere supernumerary at first, who played beside Clarisse
      the part of one of those advisers to whom we cling in the serious crises
      of our lives and who suddenly, shaking off his torpor, appeared in the
      full light of day, resolute, masterful, mettlesome, brimming over with
      daring, ready to overthrow all the obstacles that fate placed on his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was there that was capable of acting thus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville started. The question had no sooner occurred to his mind than
      the answer flashed on him, with absolute certainty. All the proofs rose
      up, each more exact, each more convincing than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly he rang. Hurriedly he sent for the chief detective-inspector on
      duty. And, feverishly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in the waiting-room, chief-inspector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur le secretaire-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see a gentleman and a lady go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you know the man again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t lose a moment, chief-inspector. Take six inspectors with you.
      Go to the Place de Clichy. Make inquiries about a man called Nicole and
      watch the house. The Nicole man is on his way back there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he comes out, monsieur le secretaire-general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest him. Here&rsquo;s a warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to his desk and wrote a name on a form:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, chief-inspector. I will let the chief-detective know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief-inspector seemed staggered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you spoke to me of a man called Nicole, monsieur le
      secretaire-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The warrant is in the name of Arsene Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsene Lupin and the Nicole man are one and the same individual.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE SCAFFOLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will save him, I will save him,&rdquo; Lupin repeated, without ceasing, in
      the taxicab in which he and Clarisse drove away. &ldquo;I swear that I will save
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarisse did not listen, sat as though numbed, as though possessed by some
      great nightmare of death, which left her ignorant of all that was
      happening outside her. And Lupin set forth his plans, perhaps more to
      reassure himself than to convince Clarisse. &ldquo;No, no, the game is not lost
      yet. There is one trump left, a huge trump, in the shape of the letters
      and documents which Vorenglade, the ex-deputy, is offering to sell to
      Daubrecq and of which Daubrecq spoke to you yesterday at Nice. I shall buy
      those letters and documents of Stanislas Vorenglade at whatever price he
      chooses to name. Then we shall go back to the police-office and I shall
      say to Prasville, &lsquo;Go to the Elysee at once ... Use the list as though it
      were genuine, save Gilbert from death and be content to acknowledge
      to-morrow, when Gilbert is saved, that the list is forged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be off, quickly!... If you refuse, well, if you refuse, the Vorenglade
      letters and documents shall be reproduced to-morrow, Tuesday, morning in
      one of the leading newspapers.&rsquo; Vorenglade will be arrested. And M.
      Prasville will find himself in prison before night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin rubbed his hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do as he&rsquo;s told!... He&rsquo;ll do as he&rsquo;s told!... I felt that at once,
      when I was with him. The thing appeared to me as a dead certainty. And I
      found Vorenglade&rsquo;s address in Daubrecq&rsquo;s pocket-books, so... driver,
      Boulevard Raspail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went to the address given. Lupin sprang from the cab, ran up three
      flights of stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant said that M. Vorenglade was away and would not be back until
      dinner-time next evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know where he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Vorenglade is in London, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin did not utter a word on returning to the cab. Clarisse, on her side,
      did not even ask him any questions, so indifferent had she become to
      everything, so absolutely did she look upon her son&rsquo;s death as an
      accomplished fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove to the Place de Cichy. As Lupin entered the house he passed two
      men who were just leaving the porter&rsquo;s box. He was too much engrossed to
      notice them. They were Prasville&rsquo;s inspectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No telegram?&rdquo; he asked his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, governor,&rdquo; replied Achille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No news of the Masher and the Growler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, governor, none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said to Clarisse, in a casual tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
      seven o&rsquo;clock and we mustn&rsquo;t reckon on seeing them before eight or nine.
      Prasville will have to wait, that&rsquo;s all. I will telephone to him to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did so and was hanging up the receiver, when he heard a moan behind
      him. Clarisse was standing by the table, reading an evening-paper. She put
      her hand to her heart, staggered and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Achille, Achille!&rdquo; cried Lupin, calling his man. &ldquo;Help me put her on my
      bed... And then go to the cupboard and get me the medicine-bottle marked
      number four, the bottle with the sleeping-draught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forced open her teeth with the point of a knife and compelled her to
      swallow half the bottle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now the poor thing won&rsquo;t wake till to-morrow... after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced through the paper, which was still clutched in Clarisse&rsquo; hand,
      and read the following lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;The strictest measures have been taken to keep order at the
 execution of Gilbert and Vaucheray, lest Arsene Lupin should make
 an attempt to rescue his accomplices from the last penalty. At
 twelve o&rsquo;clock to-night a cordon of troops will be drawn across
 all the approaches to the Sante Prison.  As already stated, the
 execution will take place outside the prison-walls, in the square
 formed by the Boulevard Arago and the Rue de la Sante.

 &ldquo;We have succeeded in obtaining some details of the attitude of
 the two condemned men.  Vaucheray observes a stolid sullenness and
 is awaiting the fatal event with no little courage:

 &ldquo;&lsquo;Crikey,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m delighted; but I&rsquo;ve got to
 go through it and I shall keep my end up.&rsquo;  And he adds, &lsquo;Death
 I don&rsquo;t care a hang about!  What worries me is the thought that
 they&rsquo;re going to cut my head off.  Ah, if the governor could only
 hit on some trick to send me straight off to the next world before
 I had time to say knife! A drop of Prussic acid, governor, if you
 please!&rsquo; 

 &ldquo;Gilbert&rsquo;s calmness is even more impressive, especially when we
 remember how he broke down at the trial.  He retains an unshaken
 confidence in the omnipotence of Arsene Lupin:

 &ldquo;&lsquo;The governor shouted to me before everybody not to be afraid,
 that he was there, that he answered for everything.  Well, I&rsquo;m not
 afraid.  I shall rely on him until the last day, until the last
 minute, at the very foot of the scaffold.  I know the governor!
 There&rsquo;s no danger with him.  He has promised and he will keep his
 word.  If my head were off, he&rsquo;d come and clap it on my shoulders
 and firmly!  Arsene Lupin allow his chum Gilbert to die?  Not he!
 Excuse my humour!&rsquo; 

 &ldquo;There is a certain touching frankness in all this enthusiasm
 which is not without a dignity of its own.  We shall see if Arsene
 Lupin deserves the confidence so blindly placed in him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Lupin was hardly able to finish reading the article for the tears that
      dimmed his eyes: tears of affection, tears of pity, tears of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he did not deserve the confidence of his chum Gilbert. Certainly, he
      had performed impossibilities; but there are circumstances in which we
      must perform more than impossibilities, in which we must show ourselves
      stronger than fate; and, this time, fate had been stronger than he. Ever
      since the first day and throughout this lamentable adventure, events had
      gone contrary to his anticipations, contrary to logic itself. Clarisse and
      he, though pursuing an identical aim, had wasted weeks in fighting each
      other. Then, at the moment when they were uniting their efforts, a series
      of ghastly disasters had come one after the other: the kidnapping of
      little Jacques, Daubrecq&rsquo;s disappearance, his imprisonment in the Lovers&rsquo; 
      Tower, Lupin&rsquo;s wound, his enforced inactivity, followed by the cunning
      manoeuvres that dragged Clarisse&mdash;and Lupin after her&mdash;to the
      south, to Italy. And then, as a crowning catastrophe, when, after
      prodigies of will-power, after miracles of perseverance, they were
      entitled to think that the Golden Fleece was won, it all came to nothing.
      The list of the Twenty-seven had no more value than the most insignificant
      scrap of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absolute defeat. What if I do
      revenge myself on Daubrecq, ruin him and destroy him? He is the real
      victor, once Gilbert is going to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wept anew, not with spite or rage, but with despair. Gilbert was going
      to die! The lad whom he called his chum, the best of his pals would be
      gone for ever, in a few hours. He could not save him. He was at the end of
      his tether. He did not even look round for a last expedient. What was the
      use?
    </p>
    <p>
      And his persuasion of his own helplessness was so deep, so definite that
      he felt no shock of any kind on receiving a telegram from the Masher that
      said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Motor accident.  Essential part broken.  Long repair.
  Arrive to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was a last proof to show that fate had uttered its decree. He no longer
      thought of rebelling against the decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Clarisse. She was peacefully sleeping; and this total
      oblivion, this absence of all consciousness, seemed to him so enviable
      that, suddenly yielding to a fit of cowardice, he seized the bottle, still
      half-filled with the sleeping-draught, and drank it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stretched himself on a couch and rang for his man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed, Achille, and don&rsquo;t wake me on any pretence whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing to be done for Gilbert and Vaucheray, governor?&rdquo;
       said Achille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they going through it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later Lupin fell into a heavy sleep. It was ten o&rsquo;clock in
      the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was full of incident and noise around the prison. At one o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning the Rue de la Sante, the Boulevard Arago and all the
      streets abutting on the gaol were guarded by police, who allowed no one to
      pass without a regular cross-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that matter, it was raining in torrents; and it seemed as though the
      lovers of this sort of show would not be very numerous. The public-houses
      were all closed by special order. At four o&rsquo;clock three companies of
      infantry came and took up their positions along the pavements, while a
      battalion occupied the Boulevard Arago in case of a surprise. Municipal
      guards cantered up and down between the lines; a whole staff of
      police-magistrates, officers and functionaries, brought together for the
      occasion, moved about among the troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guillotine was set up in silence, in the middle of the square formed
      by the boulevard and the street; and the sinister sound of hammering was
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at five o&rsquo;clock, the crowd gathered, notwithstanding the rain, and
      people began to sing. They shouted for the footlights, called for the
      curtain to rise, were exasperated to see that, at the distance at which
      the barriers had been fixed, they could hardly distinguish the uprights of
      the guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several carriages drove up, bringing official persons dressed in black.
      There were cheers and hoots, whereupon a troop of mounted municipal guards
      scattered the groups and cleared the space to a distance of three hundred
      yards from the square. Two fresh companies of soldiers lined up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly there was a great silence. A vague white light fell from the
      dark sky. The rain ceased abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the prison, at the end of the passage containing the condemned
      cells, the men in black were conversing in low voices. Prasville was
      talking to the public prosecutor, who expressed his fears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; declared Prasville, &ldquo;I assure you, it will pass without an
      incident of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do your reports mention nothing at all suspicious, monsieur le
      secretaire-general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. And they can&rsquo;t mention anything, for the simple reason that we
      have Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we know his hiding-place. The house where he lives, on the Place de
      Clichy, and where he went at seven o&rsquo;clock last night, is surrounded.
      Moreover, I know the scheme which he had contrived to save his two
      accomplices. The scheme miscarried at the last moment. We have nothing to
      fear, therefore. The law will take its course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the hour had struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took Vaucheray first; and the governor of the prison ordered the door
      of his cell to be opened. Vaucheray leapt out of bed and cast eyes dilated
      with terror upon the men who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaucheray, we have come to tell you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stow that, stow that,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;No words. I know all about it. Get
      on with the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One would have thought that he was in a hurry for it to be over as fast as
      possible, so readily did he submit to the usual preparations. But he would
      not allow any of them to speak to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No words,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What? Confess to the priest? Not worth while. I
      have shed blood. The law sheds my blood. It&rsquo;s the good old rule. We&rsquo;re
      quits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he stopped short for a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, is my mate going through it too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when he heard that Gilbert would go to the scaffold at the same time
      as himself, he had two or three seconds of hesitation, glanced at the
      bystanders, seemed about to speak, was silent and, at last, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better so.... They&rsquo;ll pull us through together... we&rsquo;ll clink
      glasses together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was not asleep either, when the men entered his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on his bed, he listened to the terrible words, tried to stand up,
      began to tremble frightfully, from head to foot, like a skeleton when
      shaken, and then fell back, sobbing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my poor mummy, poor mummy!&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tried to question him about that mother, of whom he had never spoken;
      but his tears were interrupted by a sudden fit of rebellion and he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done no murder... I won&rsquo;t die. I have done no murder...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;show yourself a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes... but I have done no murder... Why should I die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His teeth chattered so loudly that words which he uttered became
      unintelligible. He let the men do their work, made his confession, heard
      mass and then, growing calmer and almost docile, with the voice of a
      little child resigning itself, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell my mother that I beg her forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... Put what I say in the papers... She will understand... And
      then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Gilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want the governor to know that I have not lost confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at the bystanders, one after the other, as though he entertained
      the mad hope that &ldquo;the governor&rdquo; was one of them, disguised beyond
      recognition and ready to carry him off in his arms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, gently and with a sort of religious piety, &ldquo;yes, I still
      have confidence, even at this moment... Be sure and let him know, won&rsquo;t
      you?... I am positive that he will not let me die. I am certain of it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They guessed, from the fixed look in his eyes, that he saw Lupin, that he
      felt Lupin&rsquo;s shadow prowling around and seeking an inlet through which to
      get to him. And never was anything more touching than the sight of that
      stripling&mdash;clad in the strait-jacket, with his arms and legs bound,
      guarded by thousands of men&mdash;whom the executioner already held in his
      inexorable hand and who, nevertheless, hoped on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anguish wrung the hearts of all the beholders. Their eyes were dimmed with
      tears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little chap!&rdquo; stammered some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville, touched like the rest and thinking of Clarisse, repeated, in a
      whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the hour struck, the preparations were finished. They set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two processions met in the passage. Vaurheray, on seeing Gilbert,
      snapped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, kiddie, the governor&rsquo;s chucked us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he added a sentence which nobody, save Prasville, was able to
      understand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect he prefers to pocket the proceeds of the crystal stopper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went down the staircases. They crossed the prison-yards. An endless,
      horrible distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, suddenly, in the frame of the great doorway, the wan light of day,
      the rain, the street, the outlines of houses, while far-off sounds came
      through the awful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along the wall, to the corner of the boulevard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps farther Vaucheray started back: he had seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert crept along, with lowered head, supported by an executioner&rsquo;s
      assistant and by the chaplain, who made him kiss the crucifix as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood the guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; shouted Gilbert, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t... I won&rsquo;t... Help! Help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A last appeal, lost in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The executioner gave a signal. Vaucheray was laid hold of, lifted, dragged
      along, almost at a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came this staggering thing: a shot, a shot fired from the other
      side, from one of the houses opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistants stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burden which they were dragging had collapsed in their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wounded...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blood spurted from Vaucheray&rsquo;s forehead and covered his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spluttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s done it... one in a thousand! Thank you, governor, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish him off! Carry him there!&rdquo; said a voice, amid the general
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on with it... finish him off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tumult was at its height, in the little group of magistrates, officials
      and policemen. Every one was giving orders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Execute him!... The law must take its course!... We have no right to
      delay! It would be cowardice!... Execute him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the man&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes no difference!... The law must be obeyed!... Execute him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain protested, while two warders and Prasville kept their eyes on
      Gilbert. In the meantime, the assistants had taken up the corpse again and
      were carrying it to the guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; cried the executioner, scared and hoarse-voiced. &ldquo;Hurry up!
      ... And the other one to follow... Waste no time...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not finished speaking, when a second report rang out. He spun round
      on his heels and fell, groaning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing... a wound in the shoulder... Go on... The next one&rsquo;s turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his assistants were running away, yelling with terror. The space
      around the guillotine was cleared. And the prefect of police, rallying his
      men, drove everybody back to the prison, helter-skelter, like a disordered
      rabble: the magistrates, the officials, the condemned man, the chaplain,
      all who had passed through the archway two or three minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, a squad of policemen, detectives and soldiers were
      rushing upon the house, a little old-fashioned, three-storied house, with
      a ground-floor occupied by two shops which happened to be empty.
      Immediately after the first shot, they had seen, vaguely, at one of the
      windows on the second floor, a man holding a rifle in his hand and
      surrounded with a cloud of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revolver-shots were fired at him, but missed him. He, standing calmly on a
      table, took aim a second time, fired from the shoulder; and the crack of
      the second report was heard. Then he withdrew into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down below, as nobody answered the peal at the bell, the assailants
      demolished the door, which gave way almost immediately. They made for the
      staircase, but their onrush was at once stopped, on the first floor, by an
      accumulation of beds, chairs and other furniture, forming a regular
      barricade and so close-entangled that it took the aggressors four or five
      minutes to clear themselves a passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those four or five minutes lost were enough to render all pursuit
      hopeless. When they reached the second floor they heard a voice shouting
      from above:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, friends! Eighteen stairs more. A thousand apologies for giving
      you so much trouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ran up those eighteen stairs and nimbly at that! But, at the top,
      above the third story, was the garret, which was reached by a ladder and a
      trapdoor. And the fugitive had taken away the ladder and bolted the
      trapdoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will not have forgotten the sensation created by this amazing
      action, the editions of the papers issued in quick succession, the
      newsboys tearing and shouting through the streets, the whole metropolis on
      edge with indignation and, we may say, with anxious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was at the headquarters of police that the excitement developed
      into a paroxysm. Men flung themselves about on every side. Messages,
      telegrams, telephone calls followed one upon the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, there was a meeting in the
      office of the prefect of police, and Prasville was there. The
      chief-detective read a report of his inquiry, the results of which
      amounted to this: shortly before midnight yesterday some one had rung at
      the house on the Boulevard Arago. The portress, who slept in a small room
      on the ground-floor, behind one of the shops pulled the rope. A man came
      and tapped at her door. He said that he had come from the police on an
      urgent matter concerning to-morrow&rsquo;s execution. The portress opened the
      door and was at once attacked, gagged and bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later a lady and gentleman who lived on the first floor and
      who had just come home were also reduced to helplessness by the same
      individual and locked up, each in one of the two empty shops. The
      third-floor tenant underwent a similar fate, but in his own flat and his
      own bedroom, which the man was able to enter without being heard. The
      second floor was unoccupied, and the man took up his quarters there. He
      was now master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there we are!&rdquo; said the prefect of police, beginning to laugh, with a
      certain bitterness. &ldquo;There we are! It&rsquo;s as simple as shelling peas. Only,
      what surprises me is that he was able to get away so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask you to observe, monsieur le prefet, that, being absolute
      master of the house from one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he had until five
      o&rsquo;clock to prepare his flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that flight took place...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the roofs. At that spot the houses in the next street, the Rue de la
      Glaciere, are quite near and there is only one break in the roofs, about
      three yards wide, with a drop of one yard in height.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, our man had taken away the ladder leading to the garret and used it
      as a foot-bridge. After crossing to the next block of buildings, all he
      had to do was to look through the windows until he found an empty attic,
      enter one of the houses in the Rue de la Glaciere and walk out quietly
      with his hands in his pockets. In this way his flight, duly prepared
      beforehand, was effected very simply and without the least obstacle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had taken the necessary measures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those which you ordered, monsieur le prefet. My men spent three hours
      last evening visiting all the houses, so as to make sure that there was no
      stranger hiding there. At the moment when they were leaving the last house
      I had the street barred. Our man must have slipped through during that few
      minutes&rsquo; interval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! Capital! And there is no doubt in your minds, of course: it&rsquo;s
      Arsene Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt. In the first place, it was all a question of his
      accomplices. And then... and then... no one but Arsene Lupin was capable
      of contriving such a master-stroke and carrying it out with that
      inconceivable boldness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in that case,&rdquo; muttered the prefect of police&mdash;and, turning to
      Prasville, he continued&mdash;&ldquo;but, in that case, my dear Prasville, the
      fellow of whom you spoke to me, the fellow whom you and the
      chief-detective have had watched since yesterday evening, in his flat in
      the Place de Clichy, that fellow is not Arsene Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is, monsieur le prefet. There is no doubt about that either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why wasn&rsquo;t he arrested when he went out last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, this is getting complicated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite simple, monsieur le prefet. Like all the houses in which
      traces of Arsene Lupin are to be found, the house in the Place de Cichy
      has two outlets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it. I only discovered it this morning, on inspecting the
      flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no one in the flat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The servant, a man called Achille, went away this morning, taking
      with him a lady who was staying with Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the lady&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Prasville, after an imperceptible hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know the name under which Arsene Lupin passed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. M. Nicole, a private tutor, master of arts and so on. Here is his
      card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Prasville finished speaking, an office-messenger came to tell the
      prefect of police that he was wanted immediately at the Elysee. The prime
      minister was there already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he said. And he added, between his teeth, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to decide
      upon Gilbert&rsquo;s fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville ventured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they will pardon him, monsieur le prefet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! After last night&rsquo;s affair, it would make a most deplorable
      impression. Gilbert must pay his debt to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The messenger had, at the same time, handed Prasville a visiting-card.
      Prasville now looked at it, gave a start and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hanged! What a nerve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the prefect of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing, monsieur le prefet,&rdquo; declared Prasville, who did not
      wish to share with another the honour of seeing this business through.
      &ldquo;Nothing... an unexpected visit... I hope soon to have the pleasure of
      telling you the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he walked away, mumbling, with an air of amazement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word! What a nerve the beggar has! What a nerve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visiting-card which he held in his hand bore these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     M. Nicole,

      Master of Arts, Private Tutor.
</pre>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0013" id="link2HCH0013">

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE LAST BATTLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Prasville returned to his office he saw M. Nicole sitting on a bench
      in the waiting-room, with his bent back, his ailing air, his gingham
      umbrella, his rusty hat and his single glove:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s he all right,&rdquo; said Prasville, who had feared for a moment that
      Lupin might have sent another M. Nicole to see him. &ldquo;And the fact that he
      has come in person proves that he does not suspect that I have seen
      through him.&rdquo; And, for the third time, he said, &ldquo;All the same, what a
      nerve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shut the door of his office and called his secretary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Lartigue, I am having a rather dangerous person shown in here. The
      chances are that he will have to leave my office with the bracelets on. As
      soon as he is in my room, make all the necessary arrangements: send for a
      dozen inspectors and have them posted in the waiting-room and in your
      office. And take this as a definite instruction: the moment I ring, you
      are all to come in, revolvers in hand, and surround the fellow. Do you
      quite understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur le secretaire-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all, no hesitation. A sudden entrance, in a body, revolvers in
      hand. Send M. Nicole in, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was alone, Prasville covered the push of an electric bell on
      his desk with some papers and placed two revolvers of respectable
      dimensions behind a rampart of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;to sit tight. If he has the list, let&rsquo;s
      collar it. If he hasn&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s collar him. And, if possible, let&rsquo;s collar
      both. Lupin and the list of the Twenty-seven, on the same day, especially
      after the scandal of this morning, would be a scoop in a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, rising from his seat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, M. Nicole, come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole crept timidly into the room, sat down on the extreme edge of the
      chair to which Prasville pointed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come...to resume... our conversation of yesterday... Please excuse
      the delay, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One second,&rdquo; said Prasville. &ldquo;Will you allow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped briskly to the outer room and, seeing his secretary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was forgetting, M. Lartigue. Have the staircases and passages
      searched... in case of accomplices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned, settled himself comfortably, as though for a long and
      interesting conversation, and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were saying, M. Nicole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying, monsieur le secretaire-general, that I must apologize for
      keeping you waiting yesterday evening. I was detained by different
      matters. First of all, Mme. Mergy....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you had to see Mme. Mergy home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, and to look after her. You can understand the poor thing&rsquo;s
      despair... Her son Gilbert so near death... And such a death!... At that
      time we could only hope for a miracle... an impossible miracle. I myself
      was resigned to the inevitable... You know as well as I do, when fate
      shows itself implacable, one ends by despairing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought,&rdquo; observed Prasville, &ldquo;that your intention, on leaving me,
      was to drag Daubrecq&rsquo;s secret from him at all costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. But Daubrecq was not in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He was on his way to Paris in a motor-car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a motor-car, M. Nicole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when I need it: an out-of-date concern, an old tin kettle of sorts.
      Well, he was on his way to Paris in a motor-car, or rather on the roof of
      a motor-car, inside a trunk in which I packed him. But, unfortunately, the
      motor was unable to reach Paris until after the execution. Thereupon...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville stared at M. Nicole with an air of stupefaction. If he had
      retained the least doubt of the individual&rsquo;s real identity, this manner of
      dealing with Daubrecq would have removed it. By Jingo! To pack a man in a
      trunk and pitch him on the top of a motorcar!... No one but Lupin would
      indulge in such a freak, no one but Lupin would confess it with that
      ingenuous coolness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thereupon,&rdquo; echoed Prasville, &ldquo;you decided what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cast about for another method.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What method?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, surely, monsieur le secretaire-general, you know as well as I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, weren&rsquo;t you at the execution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, you saw both Vaucheray and the executioner hit, one
      mortally, the other with a slight wound. And you can&rsquo;t fail to see...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Prasville, dumbfounded, &ldquo;you confess it? It was you who
      fired the shots, this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, monsieur le secretaire-general, think! What choice had I? The list
      of the Twenty-seven which you examined was a forgery. Daubrecq, who
      possessed the genuine one, would not arrive until a few hours after the
      execution. There was therefore but one way for me to save Gilbert and
      obtain his pardon; and that was to delay the execution by a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course. By killing that infamous brute, that hardened criminal,
      Vaucheray, and wounding the executioner, I spread disorder and panic; I
      made Gilbert&rsquo;s execution physically and morally impossible; and I thus
      gained the few hours which were indispensable for my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; repeated Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; repeated Lupin, &ldquo;it gives us all&mdash;the government,
      the president and myself&mdash;time to reflect and to see the question in
      a clearer light. What do you think of it, monsieur le secretaire-general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville thought a number of things, especially that this Nicole was
      giving proof, to use a vulgar phrase, of the most infernal cheek, of a
      cheek so great that Prasville felt inclined to ask himself if he was
      really right in identifying Nicole with Lupin and Lupin with Nicole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, M. Nicole, that a man has to be a jolly good shot to kill a
      person whom he wants to kill, at a distance of a hundred yards, and to
      wound another person whom he only wants to wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had some little practice,&rdquo; said M. Nicole, with modest air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also think that your plan can only be the fruit of a long
      preparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong! It was absolutely spontaneous! If
      my servant, or rather the servant of the friend who lent me his flat in
      the Place de Clichy, had not shaken me out of my sleep, to tell me that he
      had once served as a shopman in that little house on the Boulevard Arago,
      that it did not hold many tenants and that there might be something to be
      done there, our poor Gilbert would have had his head cut off by now... and
      Mme. Mergy would most likely be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it. And that was why I jumped at that faithful retainer&rsquo;s
      suggestion. Only, you interfered with my plans, monsieur le
      secretaire-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You must needs go and take the three-cornered precaution of posting
      twelve men at the door of my house. I had to climb five flights of back
      stairs and go out through the servants&rsquo; corridor and the next house. Such
      useless fatigue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, M. Nicole. Another time...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the same thing at eight o&rsquo;clock this morning, when I was waiting
      for the motor which was bringing Daubrecq to me in his trunk: I had to
      march up and down the Place de Clichy, so as to prevent the car from
      stopping outside the door of my place and your men from interfering in my
      private affairs. Otherwise, once again, Gilbert and Clarisse Mergy would
      have been lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Prasville, &ldquo;those painful events, it seems to me, are only
      delayed for a day, two days, three days at most. To avert them for good
      and all we should want...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real list, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And I daresay you haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The genuine list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The genuine, the undoubtedly genuine list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the cross of Lorraine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the cross of Lorraine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville was silent. He was labouring under violent emotion, now that the
      duel was commencing with that adversary of whose terrifying superiority he
      was well aware; and he shuddered at the idea that Arsene Lupin, the
      formidable Arsene Lupin, was there, in front of him, calm and placid,
      pursuing his aims with as much coolness as though he had all the weapons
      in his hands and were face to face with a disarmed enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not yet daring to deliver a frontal attack, feeling almost intimidated,
      Prasville said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Daubrecq gave it up to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq gives nothing up. I took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By main force, therefore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; said M. Nicole, laughing. &ldquo;Of course, I was ready to go to
      all lengths; and, when that worthy Daubrecq was dug out of the basket in
      which he had been travelling express, with an occasional dose of
      chloroform to keep his strength up, I had prepared things so that the fun
      might begin at once. Oh, no useless tortures... no vain sufferings! No...
      Death, simply... You press the point of a long needle on the chest, where
      the heart is, and insert it gradually, softly and gently. That&rsquo;s all but
      the point would have been driven by Mme. Mergy. You understand: a mother
      is pitiless, a mother whose son is about to die!... &lsquo;Speak, Daubrecq, or
      I&rsquo;ll go deeper.... You won&rsquo;t speak?... Then I&rsquo;ll push another quarter of
      an inch... and another still.&rsquo; And the patient&rsquo;s heart stops beating, the
      heart that feels the needle coming... And another quarter of an inch...
      and one more... I swear before Heaven that the villain would have
      spoken!... We leant over him and waited for him to wake, trembling with
      impatience, so urgent was our hurry... Can&rsquo;t you picture the scene,
      monsieur le secretaire-general? The scoundrel lying on a sofa, well bound,
      bare-chested, making efforts to throw off the fumes of chloroform that
      dazed him. He breathes quicker... He gasps... He recovers
      consciousness...his lips move.... Already, Clarisse Mergy whispers, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      I... it&rsquo;s I, Clarisse... Will you answer, you wretch?&rsquo; She has put her
      finger on Daubrecq&rsquo;s chest, at the spot where the heart stirs like a
      little animal hidden under the skin. But she says to me, &lsquo;His eyes... his
      eyes... I can&rsquo;t see them under the spectacles... I want to see them...
      &lsquo;And I also want to see those eyes which I do not know, I want to see
      their anguish and I want to read in them, before I hear a word, the secret
      which is about to burst from the inmost recesses of the terrified body. I
      want to see. I long to see. The action which I am about to accomplish
      excites me beyond measure. It seems to me that, when I have seen the eyes,
      the veil will be rent asunder. I shall know things. It is a presentiment.
      It is the profound intuition of the truth that keeps me on tenterhooks.
      The eye-glasses are gone. But the thick opaque spectacles are there still.
      And I snatch them off, suddenly. And, suddenly, startled by a
      disconcerting vision, dazzled by the quick light that breaks in upon me
      and laughing, oh, but laughing fit to break my jaws, with my thumb&mdash;do
      you understand? with my thumb&mdash;hop, I force out the left eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole was really laughing, as he said, fit to break his jaws. And he
      was no longer the timid little unctuous and obsequious provincial usher,
      but a well-set-up fellow, who, after reciting and mimicking the whole
      scene with impressive ardour, was now laughing with a shrill laughter the
      sound of which made Prasville&rsquo;s flesh creep:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hop! Jump, Marquis! Out of your kennel, Towzer! What&rsquo;s the use of two
      eyes? It&rsquo;s one more than you want. Hop! I say, Clarisse, look at it
      rolling over the carpet! Mind Daubrecq&rsquo;s eye! Be careful with the grate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole, who had risen and pretended to be hunting after something
      across the room, now sat down again, took from his pocket a thing shaped
      like a marble, rolled it in the hollow of his hand, chucked it in the air,
      like a ball, put it back in his fob and said, coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq&rsquo;s left eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville was utterly bewildered. What was his strange visitor driving at?
      What did all this story mean? Pale with excitement, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all explained, it seems to me. And it fits in so well with
      things as they were, fits in with all the conjectures which I had been
      making in spite of myself and which would inevitably have led to my
      solving the mystery, if that damned Daubrecq had not so cleverly sent me
      astray! Yes, think, follow the trend of my suppositions: &lsquo;As the list is
      not to be discovered away from Daubrecq,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;it cannot
      exist away from Daubrecq. And, as it is not to be discovered in the
      clothes he wears, it must be hidden deeper still, in himself, to speak
      plainly, in his flesh, under his skin...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his eye, perhaps?&rdquo; suggested Prasville, by way of a joke...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his eye? Monsieur le secretaire-general, you have said the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, in his eye. And it is a truth that ought to have occurred to my
      mind logically, instead of being revealed to me by accident. And I will
      tell you why. Daubrecq knew that Clarisse had seen a letter from him
      instructing an English manufacturer to &lsquo;empty the crystal within, so as to
      leave a void which it was unpossible to suspect.&rsquo; Daubrecq was bound, in
      prudence, to divert any attempt at search. And it was for this reason that
      he had a crystal stopper made, &lsquo;emptied within,&rsquo; after a model supplied by
      himself. And it is this crystal stopper which you and I have been after
      for months; and it is this crystal stopper which I dug out of a packet of
      tobacco. Whereas all I had to do...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was what?&rdquo; asked Prasville, greatly puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole burst into a fresh fit of laughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was simply to go for Daubrecq&rsquo;s eye, that eye &lsquo;emptied within so as to
      leave a void which it is impossible to suspect,&rsquo; the eye which you see
      before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And M. Nicole once more took the thing from his pocket and rapped the
      table with it, producing the sound of a hard body with each rap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville whispered, in astonishment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; cried M. Nicole, laughing gaily. &ldquo;A glass eye! A common
      or garden decanter-stopper, which the rascal stuck into his eyesocket in
      the place of an eye which he had lost&mdash;a decanter-stopper, or, if you
      prefer, a crystal stopper, but the real one, this time, which he faked,
      which he hid behind the double bulwark of his spectacles and eye-glasses,
      which contained and still contains the talisman that enabled Daubrecq to
      work as he pleased in safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville lowered his head and put his hand to his forehead to hide his
      flushed face: he was almost possessing the list of the Twenty-seven. It
      lay before him, on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mastering his emotion, he said, in a casual tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is there still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I suppose so,&rdquo; declared M. Nicole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You suppose so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not opened the hiding-place. I thought, monsieur le
      secretaire-general, I would reserve that honour for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville put out his hand, took the thing up and inspected it. It was a
      block of crystal, imitating nature to perfection, with all the details of
      the eyeball, the iris, the pupil, the cornea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once saw a movable part at the back, which slid in a groove. He
      pushed it. The eye was hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tiny ball of paper inside. He unfolded it, smoothed it out
      and, quickly, without delaying to make a preliminary examination of the
      names, the hand-writing or the signatures, he raised his arms and turned
      the paper to the light from the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the cross of Lorraine there?&rdquo; asked M. Nicole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is there,&rdquo; replied Prasville. &ldquo;This is the genuine list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a few seconds and remained with his arms raised, while
      reflecting what he would do. Then he folded up the paper again, replaced
      it in its little crystal sheath and put the whole thing in his pocket. M.
      Nicole, who was looking at him, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you convinced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are agreed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, during which the two men watched each other without
      appearing to. M. Nicole seemed to be waiting for the conversation to be
      resumed. Prasville, sheltered behind the piles of books on the table, sat
      with one hand grasping his revolver and the other touching the push of the
      electric bell. He felt the whole strength of his position with a keen
      zest. He held the list. He held Lupin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he moves,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I cover him with my revolver and I ring. If he
      attacks me, I shoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the situation appeared to him so pleasant that he prolonged it, with
      the exquisite relish of an epicure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, M. Nicole took up the threads:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we are agreed, monsieur le secretaire-general, I think there is
      nothing left for you to do but to hurry. Is the execution to take place
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I shall wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer from the Elysee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is some one to bring you an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, monsieur le secretaire-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville shook his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not count on me, M. Nicole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said M. Nicole, with an air of surprise. &ldquo;May I ask the reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have changed my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. I have come to the conclusion that, as things stand, after
      this last scandal, it is impossible to try to do anything in Gilbert&rsquo;s
      favour. Besides, an attempt in this direction at the Elysee, under present
      conditions, would constitute a regular case of blackmail, to which I
      absolutely decline to lend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are free to do as you please, monsieur. Your scruples do you honour,
      though they come rather late, for they did not trouble you yesterday. But,
      in that case, monsieur le secretaire-general, as the compact between us is
      destroyed, give me back the list of the Twenty-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I may apply to another spokesman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good? Gilbert is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, not at all. On the contrary, I consider that, now that his
      accomplice is dead, it will be much easier to grant him a pardon which
      everybody will look upon as fair and humane. Give me back the list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, monsieur, you have a short memory and none too nice a
      conscience. Have you forgotten your promise of yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, I made a promise to a M. Nicole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not M. Nicole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Then, pray, who am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole made no reply, but began to laugh softly, as though pleased at
      the curious turn which the conversation was taking; and Prasville felt a
      vague misgiving at observing that fit of merriment. He grasped the
      butt-end of his revolver and wondered whether he ought not to ring for
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole drew his chair close to the desk, put his two elbows on the
      table, looked Prasville straight in the face and jeered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, M. Prasville, you know who I am and you have the assurance to play
      this game with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have that assurance,&rdquo; said Prasville, accepting the sneer without
      flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which proves that you consider me, Arsene Lupin&mdash;we may as well use
      the name: yes, Arsene Lupin&mdash;which proves that you consider me fool
      enough, dolt enough to deliver myself like this, bound hand and foot into
      your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Prasville, airily, patting the waistcoat-pocket in
      which he had secreted the crystal ball, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see what you can
      do, M. Nicole, now that Daubrecq&rsquo;s eye is here, with the list of the
      Twenty-seven inside it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I can do?&rdquo; echoed M. Nicole, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! The talisman no longer protects you; and you are now no better off
      than any other man who might venture into the very heart of the
      police-office, among some dozens of stalwart fellows posted behind each of
      those doors and some hundreds of others who will hasten up at the first
      signal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole shrugged his shoulders and gave Prasville a look of great
      commiseration:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what is happening, monsieur le secretaire-general? Well,
      you too are having your head turned by all this business. Now that you
      possess the list, your state of mind has suddenly sunk to that of a
      Daubrecq or a d&rsquo;Albufex. There is no longer even a question, in your
      thoughts, of taking it to your superiors, so that this ferment of disgrace
      and discord may be ended. No, no; a sodden temptation has seized upon you
      and intoxicated you; and, losing your head, you say to yourself, &lsquo;It is
      here, in my pocket. With its aid, I am omnipotent. It means wealth,
      absolute, unbounded power. Why not benefit by it? Why not let Gilbert and
      Clarisse Mergy die? Why not lock up that idiot of a Lupin? Why not seize
      this unparalleled piece of fortune by the forelock?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent toward Prasville and, very softly, in a friendly and confidential
      tone, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, my dear sir, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to your interest, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Or, if you absolutely insist on doing it, have the kindness first to
      consult the twenty-seven names on the list of which you have just robbed
      me and reflect, for a moment, on the name of the third person on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? And what is the name of that third person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the name of a friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stanislas Vorenglade, the ex-deputy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said Prasville, who seemed to be losing some of his
      self-confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then? Ask yourself if an inquiry, however summary, would not end by
      discovering, behind that Stanislas Vorenglade, the name of one who shared
      certain little profits with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whose name is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis Prasville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole banged the table with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of this humbug, monsieur! For twenty minutes, you and I have been
      beating about the bush. That will do. Let us understand each other. And,
      to begin with, drop your pistols. You can&rsquo;t imagine that I am frightened
      of those playthings! Stand up, sir, stand up, as I am doing, and finish
      the business: I am in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand on Prasville&rsquo;s shoulder and, speaking with great
      deliberation, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, within an hour from now, you are not back from the Elysee, bringing
      with you a line to say that the decree of pardon has been signed; if,
      within one hour and ten minutes, I, Arsene Lupin, do not walk out of this
      building safe and sound and absolutely free, this evening four Paris
      newspapers will receive four letters selected from the correspondence
      exchanged between Stanislas Vorenglade and yourself, the correspondence
      which Stanislas Vorenglade sold me this morning. Here&rsquo;s your hat, here&rsquo;s
      your overcoat, here&rsquo;s your stick. Be off. I will wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then happened this extraordinary and yet easily understood thing, that
      Prasville did not raise the slightest protest nor make the least show of
      fight. He received the sudden, far-reaching, utter conviction of what the
      personality known as Arsene Lupin meant, in all its breadth and fulness.
      He did not so much as think of carping, of pretending&mdash;as he had
      until then believed&mdash;that the letters had been destroyed by
      Vorenglade the deputy or, at any rate, that Vorenglade would not dare to
      hand them over, because, in so doing, Vorenglade was also working his own
      destruction. No, Prasville did not speak a word. He felt himself caught in
      a vise of which no human strength could force the jaws asunder. There was
      nothing to do but yield. He yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, in an hour,&rdquo; repeated M. Nicole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour,&rdquo; said Prasville, tamely. Nevertheless, in order to know
      exactly where he stood, he added, &ldquo;The letters, of course, will be
      restored to me against Gilbert&rsquo;s pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, no? In that case, there is no object in...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be restored to you, intact, two months after the day when my
      friends and I have brought about Gilbert&rsquo;s escape... thanks to the very
      slack watch which will be kept upon him, in accordance with your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there are two further conditions: first, the immediate payment of a
      cheque for forty thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sum for which Stanislas Vorenglade sold me the letters. It is only
      fair...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secondly, your resignation, within six months, of your present position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My resignation? But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Nicole made a very dignified gesture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is against public morals that one of the highest positions in
      the police-service should be occupied by a man whose hands are not
      absolutely clean. Make them send you to parliament or appoint you a
      minister, a councillor of State, an ambassador, in short, any post which
      your success in the Daubrecq case entitles you to demand. But not
      secretary-general of police; anything but that! The very thought of it
      disgusts me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville reflected for a moment. He would have rejoiced in the sudden
      destruction of his adversary and he racked his brain for the means to
      effect it. But he was helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door and called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Lartigue.&rdquo; And, sinking his voice, but not very low, for he wished M.
      Nicole to hear, &ldquo;M. Lartigue, dismiss your men. It&rsquo;s a mistake. And let no
      one come into my office while I am gone. This gentleman will wait for me
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came back, took the hat, stick and overcoat which M. Nicole handed him
      and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, sir,&rdquo; said Lupin, between his teeth, when the door was closed.
      &ldquo;You have behaved like a sportsman and a gentleman... So did I, for that
      matter... perhaps with too obvious a touch of contempt... and a little too
      bluntly. But, tush, this sort of business has to be carried through with a
      high hand! The enemy&rsquo;s got to be staggered! Besides, when one&rsquo;s own
      conscience is clear, one can&rsquo;t take up too bullying a tone with that sort
      of individual. Lift your head, Lupin. You have been the champion of
      outraged morality. Be proud of your work. And now take a chair, stretch
      out your legs and have a rest. You&rsquo;ve deserved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Prasville returned, he found Lupin sound asleep and had to tap him on
      the shoulder to wake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; asked Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done. The pardon will be signed presently. Here is the written
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The forty thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your cheque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. It but remains for me to thank you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the correspondence...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Stanislas Vorenglade correspondence will be handed to you on the
      conditions stated. However, I am glad to be able to give you, here and
      now, as a sign of my gratitude, the four letters which I meant to send to
      the papers this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so you had them on you?&rdquo; said Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt so certain, monsieur le secretaire-general, that we should end by
      coming to an understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took from his hat a fat envelope, sealed with five red seals, which was
      pinned inside the lining, and handed it to Prasville, who thrust it into
      his pocket. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le secretaire-general, I don&rsquo;t know when I shall have the
      pleasure of seeing you again. If you have the least communication to make
      to me, one line in the agony column of the Journal will be sufficient.
      Just head it, &lsquo;M. Nicole.&rsquo; Good-day to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville, when he was alone, felt as if he were waking from a nightmare
      during which he had performed incoherent actions over which his conscious
      mind had no control. He was almost thinking of ringing and causing a stir
      in the passages; but, just then, there was a tap at the door and one of
      the office-messengers came hurrying in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Prasville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le secretaire-general, it&rsquo;s Monsieur le Depute Daubrecq asking
      to see you... on a matter of the highest importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daubrecq!&rdquo; exclaimed Prasville, in bewilderment. &ldquo;Daubrecq here! Show him
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had not waited for the order. He ran up to Prasville, out of
      breath, with his clothes in disorder, a bandage over his left eye, no tie,
      no collar, looking like an escaped lunatic; and the door was not closed
      before he caught hold of Prasville with his two enormous hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you bought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the price of Gilbert&rsquo;s pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it signed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq made a furious gesture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool! You fool! You&rsquo;ve been trapped! For hatred of me, I expect? And
      now you&rsquo;re going to take your revenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a certain satisfaction, Daubrecq. Remember my little friend, the
      opera-dancer, at Nice... It&rsquo;s your turn now to dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it means prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Prasville. &ldquo;Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;re
      done for, anyhow. Deprived of the list, without defence of any kind,
      you&rsquo;re bound to fall to pieces of your own weight. And I shall be present
      at the break-up. That&rsquo;s my revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believe that!&rdquo; yelled Daubrecq, furiously. &ldquo;You believe that they
      will wring my neck like a chicken&rsquo;s and that I shall not know how to
      defend myself and that I have no claws left and no teeth to bite with!
      Well, my boy, if I do come to grief, there&rsquo;s always one who will fall with
      me and that is Master Prasville, the partner of Stanislas Vorenglade, who
      is going to hand me every proof in existence against him, so that I may
      get him sent to gaol without delay. Aha, I&rsquo;ve got you fixed, old chap!
      With those letters, you&rsquo;ll go as I please, hang it all, and there will be
      fine days yet for Daubrecq the deputy! What! You&rsquo;re laughing, are you?
      Perhaps those letters don&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville shrugged his shoulders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they exist. But Vorenglade no longer has them in his possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since this morning. Vorenglade sold them, two hours ago, for the sum of
      forty thousand francs; and I have bought them back at the same price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq burst into a great roar of laughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, how funny! Forty thousand francs! You&rsquo;ve paid forty thousand
      francs! To M. Nicole, I suppose, who sold you the list of the
      Twenty-seven? Well, would you like me to tell you the real name of M.
      Nicole? It&rsquo;s Arsene Lupin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. But what you don&rsquo;t know, you silly ass, is that I have come
      straight from Stanislas Vorenglade&rsquo;s and that Stanislas Vorenglade left
      Paris four days ago! Oh, what a joke! They&rsquo;ve sold you waste paper! And
      your forty thousand francs! What an ass! What an ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked out of the room, screaming with laughter and leaving Prasville
      absolutely dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Arsene Lupin possessed no proof at all; and, when he was threatening
      and commanding and treating Prasville with that airy insolence, it was all
      a farce, all bluff!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; thought the secretary-general. &ldquo;I have the
      sealed envelope.... It&rsquo;s here.... I have only to open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dared not open it. He handled it, weighed it, examined it... And doubt
      made its way so swiftly into his mind that he was not in the least
      surprised, when he did open it, to find that it contained four blank
      sheets of note-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am no match for those rascals. But all is not
      over yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in point of fact, all was not over. If Lupin had acted so daringly,
      it showed that the letters existed and that he relied upon buying them
      from Stanislas Vorenglade. But, as, on the other hand, Vorenglade was not
      in Paris, Prasville&rsquo;s business was simply to forestall Lupin&rsquo;s steps with
      regard to Vorenglade and obtain the restitution of those dangerous letters
      from Vorenglade at all costs. The first to arrive would be the victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville once more took his hat, coat and stick, went downstairs, stepped
      into a taxi and drove to Vorenglade&rsquo;s flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was told that the ex-deputy was expected home from London at six
      o&rsquo;clock that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Prasville therefore had plenty of
      time to prepare his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at the Gare du Nord at five o&rsquo;clock and posted all around, in
      the waiting-rooms and in the railway-offices, the three or four dozen
      detectives whom he had brought with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made him feel easy. If M. Nicole tried to speak to Vorenglade, they
      would arrest Lupin. And, to make assurance doubly sure, they would arrest
      whosoever could be suspected of being either Lupin or one of Lupin&rsquo;s
      emissaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Prasville made a close inspection of the whole station. He
      discovered nothing suspicious. But, at ten minutes to six, Chief-inspector
      Blanchon, who was with him, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq it was; and the sight of his enemy exasperated the
      secretary-general to such a pitch that he was on the verge of having him
      arrested. But he reflected that he had no excuse, no right, no warrant for
      the arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, Daubrecq&rsquo;s presence proved, with still greater force, that
      everything now depended on Stanislas Vorenglade. Vorenglade possessed the
      letters: who would end by having them? Daubrecq? Lupin? Or he, Prasville?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin was not there and could not be there. Daubrecq was not in a position
      to fight. There could be no doubt, therefore, about the result: Prasville
      would reenter into possession of his letters and, through this very fact,
      would escape Daubrecq&rsquo;s threats and Lupin&rsquo;s threats and recover all his
      freedom of action against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with orders, the stationmaster had issued instructions that
      no one was to be admitted to the platform. Prasville, therefore, walked on
      alone, in front of a number of his men, with Chief-inspector Blanchon at
      their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train drew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville almost at once saw Stanislas Vorenglade at the window of a
      first-class compartment, in the middle of the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-deputy alighted and then held out his hand to assist an old
      gentleman who was travelling with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prasville ran up to him and said, eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vorenglade... I want to speak to you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, Daubrecq, who had managed to pass the barrier,
      appeared and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Vorenglade, I have had your letter. I am at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vorenglade looked at the two men, recognized Prasville, recognized
      Daubrecq, and smiled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho, it seems that my return was awaited with some impatience! What&rsquo;s it
      all about? Certain letters, I expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... yes...&rdquo; replied the two men, fussing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that the letters are sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold! To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To this gentleman,&rdquo; said Vorenglade, pointing to his
      travelling-companion, &ldquo;to this gentleman, who thought that the business
      was worth going out of his way for and who came to Amiens to meet me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, a very old man wrapped in furs and leaning on his
      stick, took off his hat and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lupin,&rdquo; thought Prasville, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Lupin, beyond a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he glanced toward the detectives, was nearly calling them, but the old
      gentleman explained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought the letters were good enough to warrant a few hours&rsquo; 
      railway journey and the cost of two return tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two tickets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One for me and the other for one of my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he left us a few minutes ago and reached the front part of the train
      through the corridor. He was in a great hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prasville understood: Lupin had taken the precaution to bring an
      accomplice, and the accomplice was carrying off the letters. The game was
      lost, to a certainty. Lupin had a firm grip on his victim. There was
      nothing to do but submit and accept the conqueror&rsquo;s conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Prasville. &ldquo;We shall see each other when the time
      comes. Good-bye for the present, Daubrecq: you shall hear from me.&rdquo; And,
      drawing Vorenglade aside, &ldquo;As for you, Vorenglade, you are playing a
      dangerous game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the ex-deputy. &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had not uttered a word and stood motionless, as though rooted to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman went up to him and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Daubrecq, wake up, old chap... It&rsquo;s the chloroform, I expect...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq clenched his fists and gave a muttered growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see you know me!&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Then you will remember
      our interview, some months ago, when I came to see you in the Square
      Lamartine and asked you to intercede in Gilbert&rsquo;s favour. I said to you
      that day, &lsquo;Lay down your arms, save Gilbert and I will leave you in peace.
      If not, I shall take the list of the Twenty-seven from you; and then
      you&rsquo;re done for.&rsquo; Well, I have a strong suspicion that done for is what
      you are. That comes of not making terms with kind M. Lupin. Sooner or
      later, you&rsquo;re bound to lose your boots by it. However, let it be a lesson
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, here&rsquo;s your pocketbook which I forgot to give you. Excuse me
      if you find it lightened of its contents. There were not only a decent
      number of bank-notes in it, but also the receipt from the warehouse where
      you stored the Enghien things which you took back from me. I thought I
      might as well save you the trouble of taking them out yourself. It ought
      to be done by now. No, don&rsquo;t thank me: it&rsquo;s not worth mentioning.
      Good-bye, Daubrecq. And, if you should want a louis or two, to buy
      yourself a new decanter-stopper, drop me a line. Good-bye, Daubrecq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone fifty steps when he heard the sound of a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daubrecq had blown his brains out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De profundis,&rdquo; murmured Lupin, taking off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months later, Gilbert, whose sentence had been commuted to one of
      penal servitude for life, made his escape from the Ile de Re, on the day
      before that on which he was to have been transported to New Caledonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange escape. Its least details remained difficult to
      understand; and, like the two shots on the Boulevard Arago, it greatly
      enhanced Arsene Lupin&rsquo;s prestige.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken all round,&rdquo; said Lupin to me, one day, after telling me the
      different episodes of the story, &ldquo;taken all around, no enterprise has ever
      given me more trouble or cost me greater exertions than that confounded
      adventure which, if you don&rsquo;t mind, we will call, The Crystal Stopper; or,
      Never Say Die. In twelve hours, between six o&rsquo;clock in the morning and six
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening, I made up for six months of bad luck, blunders,
      gropings in the dark and reverses. I certainly count those twelve hours
      among the finest and the most glorious of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gilbert?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What became of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is farming his own land, way down in Algeria, under his real name, his
      only name of Antoine Mergy. He is married to an Englishwoman, and they
      have a son whom he insisted on calling Arsene. I often receive a bright,
      chatty, warm-hearted letter from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mme. Mergy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and her little Jacques are living with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see her again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lupin hesitated for a few moments and then said with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I will let you into a secret that will make me seem
      ridiculous in your eyes. But you know that I have always been as
      sentimental as a schoolboy and as silly as a goose. Well, on the evening
      when I went back to Clarisse Mergy and told her the news of the day&mdash;part
      of which, for that matter, she already knew&mdash;I felt two things very
      thoroughly. One was that I entertained for her a much deeper feeling than
      I thought; the other that she, on the contrary, entertained for me a
      feeling which was not without contempt, not without a rankling grudge nor
      even a certain aversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because Clarisse Mergy is an exceedingly honest woman and because I
      am... just Arsene Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, yes, an attractive bandit, a romantic and chivalrous cracksman,
      anything you please. For all that, in the eyes of a really honest woman,
      with an upright nature and a well-balanced mind, I am only the merest
      riff-raff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the wound was sharper than he was willing to admit, and I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you really loved her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I even believe,&rdquo; he said, in a jesting tone, &ldquo;that I asked her to marry
      me. After all, I had saved her son, had I not?... So... I thought. What a
      rebuff!... It produced a coolness between us... Since then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly! But it required the consolations of one Italian, two
      Americans, three Russians, a German grand-duchess and a Chinawoman to do
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after that...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that, so as to place an insuperable barrier between myself and her,
      I got married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You got married, you, Arsene Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, wedded, spliced, in the most lawful fashion. One of the greatest
      names in France. An only daughter. A colossal fortune... What! You don&rsquo;t
      know the story? Well, it&rsquo;s worth hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, straightway, Lupin, who was in a confidential vein, began to tell me
      the story of his marriage to Angelique de Sarzeau-Vendome, Princesse de
      Bourbon-Conde, to-day Sister Marie-Auguste, a humble nun in the Visitation
      Convent... [*]

    <p>
      But, after the first few words, he stopped, as though his narrative had
      suddenly ceased to interest him, and he remained pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter? Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes... There... now you&rsquo;re smiling... Is it Daubrecq&rsquo;s secret
      receptacle, his glass eye, that&rsquo;s making you laugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I tell you... only a memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasant memory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!... Yes, a delightful memory even. It was at night, off the Ile de
      Re, on the fishing-smack in which Clarisse and I were taking Gilbert
      away.... We were alone, the two of us, in the stern of the boat... And I
      remember ... I talked... I spoke words and more words... I said all that I
      had on my heart... And then... then came silence, a perturbing and
      disarming silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swear to you that the woman whom I took in my arms that night and
      kissed on the lips&mdash;oh, not for long: a few seconds only, but no
      matter!&mdash;I swear before heaven that she was something more than a
      grateful mother, something more than a friend yielding to a moment of
      susceptibility, that she was a woman also, a woman quivering with emotion
      ...&rdquo; And he continued, with a bitter laugh, &ldquo;Who ran away next day, never
      to see me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent once more. Then he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clarisse... Clarisse... On the day when I am tired and disappointed and
      weary of life, I will come to you down there, in your little Arab house
      ... in that little white house, Clarisse, where you are waiting for me...&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
